The program's influence is evident in several aspects of the lives of those involved, including the personal growth of the students, the transformation of the prison environment, and the wider implications for criminal justice reform.

The institution itself creates a progressive learning environment for the affected incarcerated individuals. This type of learning can be categorized as a special education controlled environment in relation with the reading ""Special Education Placement.""In the reading, there is a discussion regarding the disproportionate representation in education and this consists of the combined research on special education facilities. This is portrayed in the movie as having that disproportionate fallacy behind traditional structural education be completely eliminated. The institution maximizes educational methods to promote the Bard Prison initiative within the prison system in relation to the staff and the inmates' growth.

The presence of the Bard Prison initiative within the prison system has a major impact on the staff and administration. As they witness the transformation of the incarcerated individuals and the potential for rehabilitation, many staff members may begin to reevaluate their perceptions of the inmates and their capacity for change. This shift in mindset can lead to more compassionate and empathetic interactions between staff and inmates, fostering a more humane and rehabilitative approach to incarceration.

By demonstrating the transformative potential of education for incarcerated individuals, the Bard Prison initiative plays a crucial role in challenging the status quo within the criminal justice system. The program's success in reducing recidivism rates and improving the prospects of the formerly incarcerated individuals serves as evidence for the need to prioritize rehabilitation and education in prisons.

The program also highlights the systemic barriers faced by incarcerated individuals upon release, such as discrimination, stigma, and lack of resources. By raising awareness about these issues, the Bard Prison Initiative and its participants advocate for policy changes that can improve the reentry process and support the successful reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals into society.

From a student's perspective, I have very limited information towards that side of life. Research can never be enough to explore the wide variety of prison systems and how the inmates are affected. Based on the theory of rehabilitation, I can only say that this is an exemplary achievement. The benefits of such a program lay bare the truth in the systematic structural inequalities for the incarcerated inmates. The real truth that brings forward my opinion is the one that provides a sense of hope and possibility for the incarcerated individuals. Instead of wallowing in self despair from the guilt of being locked away, prisoners are given the opportunity to make themselves anew. This concept is very appealing to me as an individual. I was taught all my life that it is right to have faith in humanity and give a second chance to those who are willing to receive it. I believe that this endeavor could better the world.

In conclusion, ""College Behind Bars"" showcases the profound impact that the Bard Prison initiative has on the lives of the incarcerated individuals, the prison environment, and the wider criminal justice system.

5590,4- AI-generated,"World War II, which happened from 1939 to 1945, was a huge war that included almost every country in the world. It had two main sides: the Allies, which included big countries like the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and the Axis Powers, which were mainly Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war started because of problems left over from World War I. Germany had to follow strict rules from the Treaty of Versailles, which made life hard in Germany and helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. Hitler wanted more land for Germany, which led to the start of the war.

The war really began when Germany invaded Poland in 1939. This made Britain and France declare war on Germany. At first, there wasn't much fighting, but in 1940, Germany quickly attacked and took over many countries in Europe, including France. This fast way of fighting was called blitzkrieg, or ""lightning war.""

In 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, making the war even bigger. The Eastern Front, where Germany and the Soviet Union fought, was one of the biggest parts of the war. It was very important and had some of the biggest battles.

In the Pacific part of the war, there were many battles on islands and at sea. The United States joined the war after Japan attacked them at Pearl Harbor in 1941. Big battles happened at places like Midway and Iwo Jima.

Back home, the war changed a lot of things. Countries had to focus on making weapons and other war stuff, so many women and people from different groups started working in jobs that used to be done by men. Countries also used posters and movies to keep people supportive of the war.

One of the worst things about World War II was the Holocaust. This was when Germany killed six million Jewish people and many others. It was a very sad and terrible part of the war.

The war started to end when the Soviet Union beat Germany at the Battle of Stalingrad between 1942 and 1943. After that, the Allies landed in France on D-Day in 1944 and began to defeat Germany.

In the Pacific, the United States dropped atomic bombs on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in 1945. After that, Japan gave up, and the war was over.

7702,4- AI-generated,Discuss the ethical implications of workplace surveillance,Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,90,Likely Human,45.56,0.03,52.3,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of remote work, the ethical implications of invasive workplace surveillance have become an alarming concern for employees. While the adoption of surveillance technologies is often justified by employers in the name of productivity and security, it is crucial to recognize the inherent violation of employees' rights. This persuasive essay aims to shed light on the ethical transgressions associated with intrusive workplace surveillance during remote work and advocate for the protection of employee rights.

The widespread implementation of surveillance tools in remote work settings raises a red flag regarding the invasion of employee privacy. As individuals navigate their professional duties from the confines of their homes, employers are increasingly deploying software to monitor every keystroke, scrutinize screen activities, and even activate webcam surveillance. Such measures, purportedly enacted for the greater good, encroach upon the reasonable expectation of privacy that employees should maintain, even in a remote work environment.

By allowing pervasive surveillance, organizations risk compromising the sanctity of personal spaces and undermining the trust that employees place in their employers. This erosion of privacy extends beyond mere discomfort; it taints the employer-employee relationship with an atmosphere of suspicion and surveillance, fostering an environment that undermines the very essence of remote work-flexibility and autonomy.

Trust is the cornerstone of any healthy workplace relationship, and its erosion through invasive surveillance measures is a blatant violation of employee rights. The constant monitoring of keystrokes, screen activities, and webcam footage sends a clear message to employees-trust is an elusive commodity in the eyes of their employers. This lack of trust can lead to demotivation, decreased job satisfaction, and a toxic work environment, all of which hinder overall productivity.

Remote work promises autonomy and the freedom to manage one's responsibilities without being micromanaged. However, intrusive surveillance measures betray this promise, creating an atmosphere where employees feel like they are constantly under scrutiny. In the pursuit of productivity, organizations risk sacrificing the very foundation of a successful remote work model-trust in their workforce.

The ethical dilemma surrounding workplace surveillance in remote settings revolves around the delicate balance between organizational interests and fundamental employee rights. While employers have a legitimate interest in safeguarding data and maintaining productivity, employees have an undeniable right to work in an environment that respects their dignity, autonomy, and privacy.

Transparency is key in this delicate balancing act. Employers must communicate openly with employees about the nature, scope, and purpose of surveillance measures. Without clear communication, these measures can be perceived as overreaching and unjust, further fueling the violation of employee rights.

In conclusion, the ethical implications of workplace surveillance during remote work demand immediate attention and decisive action to protect employee rights. The erosion of privacy, the betrayal of trust, and the imbalance between organizational interests and individual rights call for a reevaluation of surveillance practices. As we navigate the complexities of remote work, let us not compromise the rights and dignity of employees in the pursuit of productivity. It is time to prioritize the ethical imperative of respecting employee rights and fostering a remote work environment that is built on trust, autonomy, and mutual respect.","ChatGPT

1458,4- AI-generated,What is the purpose of suffering?,History,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,,94,Likely AI,86.11,0.02,99.96,"Suffering, as an inherent aspect of human existence, has long captivated the minds of philosophers and spiritual seekers alike. The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, recognized the pervasiveness of suffering, placing it at the heart of his teachings. However, suffering's purpose and significance extend beyond mere philosophical contemplation; it is a deeply personal experience that shapes our lives and molds our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

In the realm of personal experiences, suffering manifests in myriad forms, from the pangs of physical pain to the emotional turmoil of loss and disappointment. It can strike at any time, shattering our expectations and challenging our resilience. Yet, amidst the depths of suffering, there lies a potential for transformation, a chance to delve into the depths of our being and emerge stronger, wiser, and more compassionate.

The Buddha's teachings offer a profound framework for navigating the labyrinth of suffering. He identified the clinging to permanence, the illusion of self, and the insatiable craving for pleasure and aversion to pain as the root causes of suffering. By understanding these underlying mechanisms, we can begin to unravel the tangled threads of our attachments and cultivate a sense of equanimity, a balanced mental state that remains unperturbed by the inevitable fluctuations of life.

The Noble Eightfold Path, the Buddha's roadmap to liberation from suffering, provides a holistic approach to cultivating wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline. It encompasses right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By embracing these principles, we can transform our relationship with suffering, recognizing it not as an enemy to be vanquished but as a teacher guiding us towards enlightenment.

From a personal perspective, suffering can serve as a catalyst for personal growth, forcing us to confront our fears, question our assumptions, and reexamine our priorities. It can compel us to cultivate empathy for others, appreciate the fragility and preciousness of life, and discover hidden reserves of strength and resilience.

In the face of suffering, we have a choice: to succumb to its debilitating effects or to harness it as an impetus for self-discovery and transformation. When embraced with courage and compassion, suffering can unveil hidden strengths, cultivate empathy for others, and foster a deeper appreciation for the fullness of life's experiences.

The Buddha's teachings and personal experiences converge in a harmonious understanding of suffering's transformative potential. By recognizing its universality, understanding its causes, and embracing it with courage and compassion, we embark on a journey of self-discovery, unlocking a reservoir of strength, wisdom, and compassion.","Google Bard

As bank's contain extremely confidential information that must be protected, however, does that protection require the violation of employee's privacy?

From the employer's perspective, they were thrown completely off guard due to the coronavirus pandemic, unprepared for a shift into working remotely. As such, the shift may not be as graceful as everyone would want it to be. It's understandable that the employer would want to monitor their employees not just to confirm their productivity, but to make sure that the company's private information is kept confidential and secure from unauthorized or outside parties. Of course we've had restrictions on this type of surveillance, such as ""The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986"", which was passed to ensure employees feel that they can do their work without having their privacy compromised (Spiggle 2020). However even this was not perfect as it allowed some exceptions.

However, employees may not want this, and it's understandable. Many want a right to privacy, some of these surveillance software are extremely invasive, watching your cameras, watching every single action you commit on your device. That kind of surveillance can make a person stressed, which inturn could actually decrease their productivity. It can also create a distrust between the employee and the employer, as remote surveillance could easily destroy the established trust between them (Blackman 2020). It's uncomfortable to know that every single action you're taking may be monitored, it makes the employee uneasy.

As a result of the pandemic, there has been a large increase in remote work, and this shift may still be seen even after it's safe to return to working in the office, as employers may see it was just cheaper to have workers work at home. Because of this, we may see workplace surveillance extended into the future as employers will now have had experience with these softwares. As such, these controversies and conversation on this topic will still be had, as employers will be reluctant or hesitant, for the fear of wanting to maintain productivity.

I have dealt with workplace surveillance before, during my summer after junior high school. During it, I worked a job at a small store that was occupied alongside a gas station. In it, there were cameras placed both in the shopping area of the store, but also the small break room we had. Of course these cameras existed to make sure there was footage incase of an incident or robbery, but they also served as a sort of surveillance, as the employer would make sure we were actually working and focused on whatever our task was. I paid no disagreement to these cameras, as they were also there to record footage and to make sure the establishment was working properly.",
894,2- Written by me but grammar was corrected by AI,What do you think is the purpose of suffering?,History,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,15,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,55,0.25,0,"Suffering exists, it has a presence that everyone has experienced before. It can occur in numerous ways and methods, and can be both physical and mental. It can exist on a large scale from being only slightly annoying to something that is intolerable. The concept refers to an experience that causes unpleasantness and a type of distress and hardship. It is commonly addressed in philosophy, especially philosophy from the Ancient Greeks. It even appears in religion, explaining the important role they play when it comes to concepts such as relief or spirituality. As such, there are many different views on it, with some saying its punishment and others saying its a path to something greater. So what is the purpose of suffering?

Suffering has a purpose, and that is to teach us to be better and help us evolve. It serves as an important experience to learn both socially and personally. It exists to teach us to be better. As we suffer, we not only gain knowledge we didn't have beforehand, but it makes us strive to change how we live and act. Suffering can be the consequence of a negative action, or sometimes it can be unrelated, but it gives us the opportunity to better ourselves and shape how we act in the future, whether that be to avoid that suffering again or to gain redemption in the eyes of society, or even what they perceive as the universe or god. Such as Buddhism, where suffering is one of the four noble truths, it has a cause and end, and exits to lead to spiritual enlightenment.

These experiences force us to grow as not only individuals but as a society as a whole. For example, imagine you experience a suffering of not being able to get to a destination within a certain timeframe, you suffer as your freedom of move is limited by technology. This is an experience of suffering from lack of fast transport, and it will force people to strive to develop new technologies to remove this problem, so we will never experience this type of suffering ever again. We saw a problem that gave us annoyance or pain, and we sought to fix it in order to rid ourselves of experiencing the same thing in the future again. It gives us a reason to improve, to be better, and this furthers our society and humanity as a whole as we grow. Suffering is an essential to making progress and advancing, we need it to gain the experiences we require to move forward, because without it, we wouldn't have an inclination to do better, to not suffer.

Purpose changes the way we view suffering, our experience of it and our interpretation. As now, it gives meaning to it, we just don't just suffer and that's the end of it, we get something out of it. Even many religions, coin the idea that while suffering comes from a negative action, it can lead to redemption or spiritual progress. For example, in Hinduism, it has a purpose of helping someone achieve liberation and spiritual progress of their past crimes or immoral actions. Or in many christnaity, where the concept of redemptive suffering exists, allowing oneself to redeem themselves in the eyes of god for the sins they've committed. It all depends on how a person views it.

Without suffering, life would be meaningless as there would be no reason to change the way we are. There would be no benefit. You can interpret it many ways, just as people before us have, but the existence of suffering has forced humans to develop new techniques and technologies to better our lives and ease our pain. Whether you want to believe it's for spiritual redemption or human existence, it has a purpose to help us, and may always exist.",

However, the Internet was mainly human-centered, as it used to unite people and allow them to exchange digital information; until the notion Internet of things (IoT) appeared. IoT is a network that connects non-living physical objects that can use the Internet. Things may differ, ranging from a health watch that collects information to the multimedia system of cars and home utilities (Bourgeois et al., 2019). This work will discuss the overview of IoT, including the role and importance of IoT in a community, ethical issues, and information security.
The principle of communication between objects in the Internet of things is based mainly on hardware and software. For instance, a health watch may be equipped with a sensor capable of tracking the heartbeat rate, which could be stored in the watch system and utilized by the processor. The collected data could be exchanged via the device's Internet connection, and the objects often make the communication independently. The real-time communication update between things may open various possibilities for people. The person could control the technological devices at home without being physically present, as the air conditioning system could be connected to a smartphone by the Internet (Allhoff & Henschke, 2018). The information that the devices may collect is first stored in the internal memory of a device and then sent into the gateway of IoT. Further, the information that passes the gateway will be stored in the cloud (Hassan & Awad, 2018). Other devices can access the data stored in the cloud for executive or analytical purposes.

The Internet of things is crucial in society due to its various benefits. One of the most profound advantages of IoT could be the potential of analytics. As the data is collected, it may be thoroughly analyzed and categorized to develop various patterns and predictions for the future. As a result, enhanced decision-making could emerge from the effective analytics of the collected data. Another core benefit of IoT is the improved convenience of users. As mentioned earlier, a person could be connected to devices communicating via the Internet at extreme distances. For instance, a person could monitor the security cameras that upload real-time footage to the cloud, and the monitoring could be made from a smartphone connected to the Internet (Turgut & Boloni, 2017). The connection of things to the Internet is mainly directed at optimizing human lives by improving convenience and implementing analytics to advance decision-making.

Despite the significant advantages directed toward improving people's lives, the Internet of things may have various ethical implications that may cause discomfort. Although the types of ethical challenges could be different, they may have the same core- the invasion of privacy. The number of technological devices surrounding people is high in the modern world, and those objects may invade their users' privacy. People may not fully realize their actions by agreeing to the terms of procedures of health watches, electronic utilities, and even car multi-media systems. The great invasion of privacy conducted by technological devices while collecting the data. Devices may collect all data types using sensors, tracking systems, and Internet searches. Users often do not realize and have limited information about how the collected data is used and its final purpose (Saleem et al., 2018). The collected data may be used for different reasons, including the targeted marketing suggestions based on preferences identified by the data analysis.

Furthermore, IoT can have different challenges to the security of collected information. The devices that collect data could often build with the sole purpose of collecting and sending data, and they could be vulnerable to versatile attacks. For instance, the health bracelet that collects personal data about one's health could have a limited malware defense system, and a virus could disrupt the device's software. Moreover, they could be physically vulnerable to hacking. In case when a technological device is stolen or lost, it could be found and easily hacked. The issues above may lead to a fundamental IoT issue, the data leak. The leaked data obtained from various devices connected to the Internet could contain private information, and criminals could use this data for malicious purposes (Miloslavskaya & Tolstoy, 2018). The devices connected to the Internet have a significant advantage of speed and availability, but they may be exposed to digital attacks such as malware or hacking.

The Internet of things is a fast-developing notion in a progressive technology environment. The benefits of IoT are greatly helping the users, as the devices are united and can be accessed from long distances, demanding just an Internet connection. Further, IoT improved the overall decision-making process due to the forecasts and assumptions derived from a proper analysis of collected data, allowing people to make decisions with minimized risks and enhanced accuracy. However, their Internet connection could compromise users' security and raise ethical questions. The amount and range of collected data may cause an invasion of privacy, and they may be vulnerable to digital threats. IoT's improved security could improve people's trust in devices, as they may not be afraid of data leaks and software corruption.",
4673,4- AI-generated,"How and why, according to Giridharadas, do thought leaders provide elites with the ""semblance""of palatable ideas?",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by AI,91,Likely Human,33.33,99.96,13.99,"In his insightful exploration of societal dynamics, Anand Giridharadas delves into the intriguing symbiosis between thought leaders and the elite. Central to his analysis is the concept of thought leaders providing elites with the ""semblance"" of palatable ideas- a carefully crafted illusion that serves the interests of the privileged few. In this essay, we embark on an examination of how and why thought leaders undertake this role, delving into the human aspects that underpin this intricate relationship.

One of the primary mechanisms through which thought leaders create this semblance is the curation of ideas. Acting as intellectual gatekeepers, they sift through the vast landscape of ideologies and selectively choose those that align with the interests of the elite. In doing so, thought leaders offer a curated narrative that appears inclusive, yet subtly reinforces existing power structures. This curation serves as a means for the elite to control the discourse without overtly appearing exclusive.

Language and framing emerge as potent tools in the arsenal of thought leaders. The choice of words and the framing of ideas play a pivotal role in rendering potentially controversial or self-serving notions more digestible to a wider audience. Through linguistic finesse, thought leaders create a narrative that resonates both with the elite and the public, presenting ideas in a way that appears universally acceptable while preserving the status quo.

Another dimension of this intricate dance is the provision of intellectual cover. Thought leaders, through articulate arguments and well-researched perspectives, lend an air of legitimacy to ideas that may primarily serve elite agendas. This intellectual cover not only shields the elite from criticism but also elevates their influence on societal narratives. In this symbiotic relationship, thought leaders become the conduits through which the elite can assert their influence without facing the full force of public scrutiny.

The delicate balance between acknowledging social responsibility and preserving elite interests is a tightrope walk for thought leaders. By advocating for socially conscious ideals within the predefined parameters set by the elite, these influencers create an illusion of benevolence while safeguarding the status quo. This strategic navigation ensures that the elite can maintain their influence without appearing entirely detached from the pressing concerns of society.

Selective engagement further characterizes the role of thought leaders. They address societal issues that align with elite interests, while sidelining more radical or transformative ideas. This selective engagement allows the elite to showcase a commitment to change without compromising their core interests. Thought leaders become strategic players in signaling progress without fundamentally challenging the existing power structures.

In conclusion, Giridharadas invites us to critically assess the symbiotic relationship between thought leaders and the elite, unraveling the intricacies of how the former provides a semblance of palatability to ideas that primarily serve the privileged few. As we navigate this complex interplay, it is essential to question the motives behind the narratives propagated by thought leaders, empowering ourselves to see beyond the veneer and strive for a more inclusive and equitable discourse. The human dimensions of this relationship beckon us to reflect on the role of ideas in shaping our collective understanding of societal issues and to envision a future where the discourse is not merely curated, but authentically reflective of the diverse voices within our society.",make the essay as human as possible

Giridharadas and Foer both touch on this topic from different angles in their writings.

But there's a shadowy side to this whole scene. You've got these big shots and mega-corporations that kinda pull the strings on what we see, think, and care about. Giridharadas and Foer dive into this mess from different angles in their writings.

Giridharadas spills the beans on how these high-flyers in what he calls ""MarketWorld"" have their own set of pet ideas. They back these ideas up by throwing support behind thought leaders who sing the same tune. Giridharadas puts it bluntly, saying, ""MarketWorld finds certain ideas more acceptable... and does its part to help them through its patronage of thought leaders."" These thought leaders then hog the spotlight- writing op-eds, snagging book deals, giving their two cents on TV, and even advising big shots in power. So, basically, these favored ideas get a VIP pass into the public arena, and that's what most folks end up hearing about.

Now, Foer jumps into the ring talking about Facebook. He spills the beans on how the platform plays puppeteer with its algorithms. Facebook is like your nosy neighbor, always watching and nudging you in a certain direction. As Foer puts it, ""Facebook paternalistically nudges users in the direction it deems best for them."" Sounds harmless, right? Wrong. This nudging doesn't just happen for fun- it's to hook you, addict you to the platform. Sneaky, right?

So, how's all this elite and corporate influence a threat to society? Well, Giridharadas makes it clear that these thought leaders and their ideas aren't just hogging the spotlight at conferences. They're also elbowing out other voices. This creates a one-sided narrative, stifling diverse perspectives. Plus, these favored ideas might not be what's best for everyone- they could just be what's best for the elite.

And then there's Facebook, the puppeteer of our online lives. Foer warns that while we think we're choosing what we see, Facebook's actually pulling the strings, pushing us toward content that keeps us hooked but might not be the healthiest for our minds. It's like being in a bubble where you only hear what Facebook wants you to, reinforcing your existing beliefs and keeping you blissfully unaware of other viewpoints.

In the end, this elite and corporate influence isn't just shaping what we talk about; it's messing with how we think and make decisions. It's like someone playing DJ with our thoughts, and that's a pretty messed-up situation for any society. We need a real mix of ideas, not just the ones the big shots want us to hear, to keep things fair and square. If we don't watch out, we might end up dancing to a tune that's not in our best interest.","ChatGPT

The influence of technology and people's opinions have undoubtedly consumed the public into thinking or acting in unconventional ways mainly due to the influence of a power that persuades them in a certain manner altering their thoughts and beliefs. The similarity in the two excerpts are the use of a certain authority influencing the society into hearing or reading ideas that the public are most likely to succumb to, such as the thought leaders or the algorithms that may influence or change the perspective of an individual. Although the aim for both the mediums are common, it is interesting to explore and understand how we can achieve the influence of a society through the words or a set of rules created by a human on a computer to achieve a similar level of influence. The elite and corporate's influence is arguably a threat, because the impact of its nature to the society do not wholly allow the society to opine individually, but rather conform to a power of higher authority, disallowing the voice of change or understanding the consensus of the society as a whole.

The thought leaders' opinions are generally considered to be the ventriloquist of the elites, and the ""algorithms""of Facebook are a set of rules made by humans to fuel content to the society. The thought leaders are generally well known by the public and their expression of thoughts would generally be received by a wide range of people from the public. Although thought leaders express their opinions, these opinions are commonly not what the public wants to hear but rather what the elites want the public to hear. For instance, ""the thought leaders have often been deployed to help us see problems in precisely the opposite way""( Giridharadas 100), implying that the ""deployment""is a bane rather than a source of intellectual opinion or advice towards the society. When the crux of the problem is identified, the thought leaders always find a workaround and offer the solutions that the elites want to hear as compared to what the society as a whole is supposed to hear. When these ideas and thoughts are put out to the general public, they tend to coincide with an agreement due to the nature of these prominent figures, than to come up with a self-realisation that the solution the thought leaders may have suggested is incorrect or not ideal in such a circumstance. This leads to an elite-centric way of finding a solution than a society-centric method that would solve the problem as a whole which would benefit the society more than benefitting the elites. A multibillion corporation such as Facebook has a plethora of users that trust the content provided to the public and use the function on a daily basis fuelled to them personally by ""algorithms"". In today's digital age where we can view speeches or videos of thought leaders through platforms such as Facebook, have deeply attracted the attention of various members of society. There is a sense of responsibility owed by Facebook, in the sense that the content displayed by Facebook's algorithms must be factually accurate and not biased. However, the algorithm changed by ""adjusting the quality of political and cultural discourse in order to hold the attention of users for a few more beats.(Foer 113). It is debatable to what extent this is allowed due to the nature of sensitive material that runs behind a political or cultural agenda. Behind every political scene, is a plutocrat hoping to secure their personal agenda. Their form of outreach would ideally be a platform that is used widely by the public i.e. Facebook. Facebook is not shy to elucidate that ""In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company. We have this large community of people, and more than other technology companies we're really setting policies!' (Foer 106). Zuckerberg is not shy to express how big his little college experiment has turned out in the digital age, where they are ""setting policies"", indicating they are comparable to the elites who behind the scenes also perform policy making through the use of the thought leaders.

4882,1- Entirely written by me,"How and why, according to Giridharadas, do thought leaders provide elites with the ""semblance""of palatable ideas?",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,11.76,0.41,0,"The thought leaders are attracted by the idea of climbing the ladder of fame obtaining a celebrity status and the monetary gains offered by the elites. The critical idea that the author aims to convey to the readers is often how some thought leaders often neglect the idea of social justice and poverty as explained by ""inequality"", by downplaying the situation, as such ideas ""are usually unacceptable to elites"". It is beneficial ""for the elites to be seen as favouring change"", than to change anything. The reason why the elites seem to be ""favouring change""is solely because such scenarios do not in the end benefit the elites in any instance, even if they were to place their interests on idea of social justice. Giridharadas often mentions these ""plutocrats""or the elites as the people in power, more often than not these thought leaders succumb to the pressure of these elites or ""plutocrats""to achieve the goal they aim to hear and not what the thought leader has to put out due to their future prospects and their potential to grow to further heights. To further expand the thought leaders potential to succeed, they need to obtain the approval of the elites that are currently interested in them. Offering alternative solutions such as ""Big Data""would attract the attention of possibly multibillion dollar companies. These thought leaders who do not affirm to ideas such as social responsibility cut moral corners and rely on MarketWorld for the sustenance of their careers to obtain their future connections. ""What a thought leader might offer MarketWorldand its winners is a kind of intellectual counteroffer""to the elites, offering them a ""semblance""of change but in reality would not have an impact greater or equal to that of a critic in an instance involving the idea of a critic versus a thought leader. An idea of an ""intellectual counteroffer""and a feasible method of change can be elaborated by the idea of ""educating poor children in a time of declining social mobility"". The thought leaders idea in this case yield in favour of MarketWorld to offer their expertise in ideas such as ""Big Data to better compensate star teachers and weed out bad ones""rather than a mainstream idea of how the problem should be handled as the critic portrays it, in which case is the more ideal solution to the problem. ""A true critic might call for an end to funding schools by local property taxes and the creation as in many advanced countries, of a common national pool that funds schools more or less equally"", the idea of a critic which is apt in such a scenario would benefit the teachers and the students to receive a fair income and good education respectively, would not be accepted by the elite. If such a situation was placed, the elites who pay the bulk of property tax would not receive the benefits for their neighbourhood, and instead the common population would be enjoying the wealth of the elites. The thought leaders solution however, would benefit both the elites, but will not benefit the teachers or the school. The solutions offered by the thought leader offers an easier solution to fix the problems that exist, but in reality, these solutions only seem to provide change and benefit to those involved and offers an acceptable solution by the elites. The thought leaders like other humans have their need to obtain personal security (""I've got to make a living""Giridharadas 116) , such as money as explained in the Maslow'shierarchy of needs. Money can liberate the top thought leaders from the institutions (Giridharadas 104) such as academic ones, which provides us the insight that money has a huge influence in whether the individual decides to be on the side of change or the side providing a ""semblance of change"". This often means that in reality if the thought leaders would want to receive any form of income, they would have to please the elites and offer solutions that elites would be open to and not the wider public. An example in this instance would be Amy Cuddy, who was considered a model in her field of academia. As she grew into the space of MarketWorld, her original aims and goals of contributing to the public were strayed from and instead decided to pursue to the idea of becoming a thought leader. Her success in that avenue, launched her fame amongst the MarketWorldcommunity, which even led to her Ted Talk becoming extremely popular skyrocketing her fame. Through this example, we are able to see the change of a well-established or a public intellectual academic into a thought leader.

In a common space of plutocrat wealth, thought leaders portray themselves as an ""intellectual celebrity""to engage in public conversation. An age where public intellectuals could opine into the academic or general crowd is often now replaced by thought leaders of which some of them are backed by elites. The thought leaders would align generally towards what the elites want to hear from (""the speaker about the context of the event and what is ""top of mind"" for attendees""Giridharadas 103). Often, these thought leaders would provide ideas that would benefit the elites and the society. A question such as ""extreme wealth inequality, a critic might call for economic redistribution or even racial reparations""would not benefit the elites in any manner since the economic redistribution would affect them gravely. This would however be argued by a thought leader ""on how foundation bosses should be paid higher salaries so that the poor can benefit from the most capable leadership"", this situation again provides a ""semblance of change"", offering better leadership could lead to better prospects for the economically disadvantage but in reality would, these elites become even more financially powerful.These plutocrats cause these thought leaders to distort and stray from the main idea intended to be portrayed since they are supporting these thought leaders financially. Their involvement with the elites mean that they are""participating in MarketWorld's preservation of a troubled status quo by gesturing to change-making""and their commitment to preserving their status quo, would in return financially and socially climb to greater heights. Giridharadas employs the use of ordinal adverbs (Giridharadas 96-97) to effectively convey to the readers the importance of understanding the thought process of a thought leader. These thought leaders often gain significantly lesser from the public audience other than public appreciation since they are already well established in their field. Their opinions would have little to none effect in what they establish due to their wide acceptance amongst other educated audience, who are also most likely backed by plutocrats. These thought leaders would offer the elites what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear resulting in aninstability of what the reality is and what needs to be done to rectify it. The problems such as inequality can be looked at the bigger picture by ""zooming out""but the cost of it would possibly not be justified by the elites.

Introduction



Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman, unwittingly became a central figure in the history of medical research when her cancer cells were used to establish the HeLa cell line in the 1950s. The story of Henrietta Lacks raises numerous ethical questions that continue to resonate in the field of medical research. This paper aims to assess the medical ethics issues surrounding Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cell line, focusing on ethical violations and the question of whether the Lacks family should have received monetary compensation.



Ethical Violations



One of the primary ethical violations in the HeLa case is the lack of informed consent. Henrietta Lacks, a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital, was never informed that her cells would be used for research, nor did she provide explicit consent. At that time, the concept of informed consent was not as firmly established as it is today, and researchers often assumed broad consent for the use of leftover tissues. However, this practice raises significant ethical concerns, as individuals have a right to know and decide how their biological materials will be used.



Furthermore, the use of Henrietta Lacks' cells without her knowledge or consent reflects a broader issue of exploitation, especially given the racial and socioeconomic disparities prevalent during that era. Henrietta Lacks and her family were not afforded the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding the use of her cells, a practice that reflects a disregard for individual autonomy and dignity.



The lack of privacy protection is another ethical violation in the HeLa case. Henrietta Lacks' identity was not initially anonymized, and her medical records were accessible to researchers. This lack of privacy safeguards raises concerns about confidentiality and the potential misuse of personal information. The breach of privacy has implications for the broader discussion about the responsible use of patient data in research.



Monetary Compensation for the Lacks Family



The question of whether the Lacks family should have received monetary compensation for the HeLa cell line is complex. On one hand, the commercialization and widespread use of HeLa cells have led to significant advancements in medical research, contributing to the development of vaccines, cancer treatments, and numerous scientific breakthroughs. On the other hand, the Lacks family's lack of awareness and consent raises ethical questions about profiting from the unauthorized use of biological materials.



While monetary compensation cannot fully address the historical injustice suffered by the Lacks family, it can acknowledge their contribution and mitigate the economic disparities that persist. Establishing a fair system for compensating individuals or their families for the commercial use of their cells would align with principles of justice and equity.



Free Availability vs. Individual Profit



The question of whether cell lines should be freely available for research or if individuals should profit from the use of their cells touches on the tension between scientific progress and individual rights. Advocates for open access argue that freely available cell lines facilitate collaborative research, accelerate discoveries, and benefit humanity at large. However, this approach should be balanced with ethical considerations, including informed consent and fair compensation.



Individuals contributing biological materials for research should have the right to control how their cells are used, and they should be informed about potential commercial applications. Establishing a framework that allows for both scientific advancement and individual compensation would be a more ethical approach. This could involve developing consent mechanisms that specify the potential uses of biological materials and implementing systems for fair compensation in cases where commercial benefits arise.



Conclusion



The story of Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cell line highlights the complex ethical landscape of medical research. The lack of informed consent, privacy violations, and the commercial use of cells without compensation to the Lacks family raise serious ethical concerns. While the scientific community has benefited immensely from the HeLa cell line, it is essential to reassess the ethical norms governing the use of human biological materials in research.



Moving forward, a balance must be struck between the pursuit of scientific knowledge and the protection of individual rights. This involves implementing robust informed consent procedures, safeguarding privacy, and exploring fair compensation mechanisms for individuals whose biological materials contribute to scientific advancements. In doing so, the medical research community can ensure that future discoveries are not only scientifically groundbreaking but also ethically sound.",ChatGPT

In Frankenstein, the physician scientist is depicted as a person who is willing to cross ethical boundaries in order to achieve his goals. Victor Frankenstein is so obsessed with his work that he is willing to create life from dead tissue, even though he knows that it is morally wrong. He is so focused on his work that he does not consider the consequences of his actions. The movie tells us that the physician researcher has a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of their work and to ensure that they do not cause harm to others.

In Arrowsmith, the physician scientist is depicted as a person who is committed to his work but also recognizes the importance of ethical considerations. Martin Arrowsmith is a scientist who is dedicated to finding a cure for the plague. He is willing to take risks and to experiment in order to achieve his goals, but he is also aware of the ethical implications of his work. He recognizes that his work has the potential to cause harm and he takes steps to ensure that his research is conducted in an ethical manner. The movie tells us that the physician researcher has a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of their work and to ensure that they do not cause harm to others.

The two movies are similar in their portrayal of the physician scientist as a person who is dedicated to their work and willing to take risks in order to achieve their goals. However, they differ in their portrayal of the physician scientist's ethical responsibilities. Frankenstein portrays the physician scientist as a person who is willing to cross ethical boundaries in order to achieve his goals, while Arrowsmith portrays the physician scientist as a person who is committed to his work but also recognizes the importance of ethical considerations.

In the early 20th century, medical ethics were still in their infancy.[ The Nuremberg Code, which established ethical guidelines for medical research, was not developed until after World War II 1] (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/bioethics/timeline/index.cfm).

Arrowsmith

Throughout history there have been numerous advancements surrounding medicine related discoveries with medical ethics being challenged along the way. The 1931 movie, Frankenstein, depicts a disregard for medical ethics as the ""mad""scientist Henry Frankenstein acts in disgruntled manners with clear ignorance towards the safety of the public. On the other hand, the 1931 movie Arrowsmith presents the rational scientific journey of physician Martin Arrowsmith. While both physicians share similarities in regards to their dedication to their work, they vastly differ ethically and partake in various ethical responsibilities that reveal the ideas surrounding medical ethics in the 20th century.

The two physicians, Dr. Henry Frankenstein and Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, are both immensely dedicated to science and their discoveries. In Frankenstein, Henry Frankenstein goes to extreme lengths in order to build his success, for example, he is a grave-digger and hunts for specific body parts that he needs in order to build his specimen. Dr. Frankenstein, along with his assistant, steals a brain from a medical center, which is actually an ""abnormal""brain, because it is essential to their discovery. In addition, the ""mad""physician also sacrifices time and refuses seeing people in his workspace because he seems to prioritize his work over external distractions. While Dr. Henry Frankenstein is very extreme about his work, he exudes passion, even though the measures he takes are very unethical. Similarly, Dr. Martin Arrowsmith also resembles the same passion, but in a more sensible and honest method. For example, the movie depicts Dr. Arrowsmith sacrificing numerous years to his work and illustrates his efforts in gaining success with his experiments. Even as a physician, he took particular interest in the black leg disease in cows and conducted research to find an effective serum for the situation, even though healing animals is a veterinarians's field. Arrowsmith's passion for research and discovery is evident through his drive to make a positive impact on the public's health. Even though both physicians share being committed to their projects, they differ ethically in many ways.

While Dr. Henry Frankenstein held an abundance of passion for his work, his process is overall unethical, in comparison to Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, who held a more thoughtful and respectful approach to his methodology. Specifically, Dr. Frankenstein stealing body parts from graves and using it to build his specimen not only goes against the basic fundamentals of respecting the dead, but also asking permission from families if the body can be used for research. In the movie, Dr. Martin Arrowsmith seemed to be informing his patients of his actions and never dared to cross the line of not asking for permission. In addition, Dr. Frankenstein harmed his creation with violence, which could have potentially triggered the ""monster's""own violence as it learned violence was its defense against danger. By not containing danger, Dr. Frankenstein put the townspeople at risk, which defies the ethical saying of putting the public's safety in front of an experiment's success. Throughout the movie, Dr. Martin Arrowsmith has put others' needs before his own. For example, he maintained good relationships with the townspeople and aided a little boy in removing his tooth before prioritizing his own work. Similarly, Dr. Martin Arrowsmith risked his own health to provide a cure to the plague cursing the West Indies and also the rest of the world. By helping the island he not only found a cure for the entire world, but he also gained personal success from his efforts. Even though his intentions for visiting the island were to experiment and see if his serum was effective, the people on the island were already dying, and his overall goal as stated in the movie was to make a positive impact on mankind's health. Clearly, Dr. Arrowsmith was selfless and followed the basic medical ethics of putting the public's needs before his own gain. The difference in morals and priorities of each physician depicts the variation of medical ethics in the 20th century.

As both movies occurred during the 20th century, it is shocking to see the difference in medical ethics between both physicians. Dr. Henry Frankenstein seems to represent the rebellious physician who does not follow the laws of proper practice, classifying him as a physician who did not care about ethical responsibilities, and only focused on success. On the other hand, Dr. Arrowsmith differed from his peers who attempted to pressure him to follow unethical guidelines that put people at risk. Overall, as medical ethics became more established in the 20th century, each movie represented physicians on opposite ends of the ethical responsibilities spectrum.",

What, in your opinion, were the ethical violations in this story? Why? Include a consideration about the question whether or not the Lacks family should have received monetary compensation for the cell line. Should cell lines be freely available for research, given that the developments stemming from the research benefit humanity at large? Or should individuals profit if their cells get used for research? Why/why not?",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,37,Likely Human,16.67,0.02,20.6,"Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa Cell Line

Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman who revolutionized medicine, was found to have ""immortal""cancer cells, which she was unaware about, but doctors utilized for research purposes. African Americans faced discrimination in the mid-20th century, but at the Hopkins hospital, they were able to receive treatment, even though segregation and neglect were still prevelant in this setting. Here, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer and Doctor George Gey collected a mass of Henrietta's cells and discovered he could maintain them to stay alive and grow, naming the discovery of the cell line HeLa after Henrietta Lacks. Even though Henrietta's cells were an important discovery for research, her identity initially remained anonymous and she soon died from cancer, so Lacks and her family did not receive any compensation from the discovery of HeLa. From Henrietta's treatment and diagnosis to the discovery of HeLa to the distribution of the cell line for research, medical ethics were violated.

Concerning the treatment for the cancer, during the operation where radium was inserted into Henrietta's cervix, an unconsented and significantly important piece of information was untold to Henrietta. During the operation, ""though no one had told Henrietta that TeLinde was collecting samples or asked if she wanted to be a donor- Wharton picked up a sharp knife and shaved two dime-sized pieces of tissue from Henrietta's cervix: one from her tumor, and one from the healthy cervical tissue nearby""(Skloot, pg. 33). The lack of consent violates medical ethics as tissue was uninformingly taken from Lacks for the purpose of cell research, and allegedly this same incident occurred to numerous other patients as well since Gey took advantage of operations to gain cell samples from patients for research. Even though Gey conducted his research to analyze cell growth and learn more about cancer, taking both cancerous and healthy tissue violates a medical right of being informed of what your body is being used for. Since Henrietta's cells were able to stay alive and multiply rapidly, ""scientists [were able] to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections""(Skloot, pg. 58). As Gey distributed the cells and scientists were able to gain access to the HeLa cell line, the cells were used for various research purposes and were further commercialized due to being inexpensive and having rapid growth. The Tuskegee center was able to use HeLa cells to combat polio as, ""With those cells, scientists helped prove the Salk vaccine effective""(Skloot, pg. 96). The commercialization of HeLa cells can be demonstrated for example, ""it became clear that there was no risk of a HeLa shortage, they [the Tuskegee Center] began sending the cells to any scientists interested in buying them, for ten dollars plus air Express fees ""(Skloot, pg. 97). HeLa cells helped create profits and significant recognitions for various pharmaceutical and research organizations, however, Lacks and her family gained no reimbursement or information regarding this commercialization. Lacks and her family were uninformed of the usage of HeLa cells and did not give consent for how certain information, like genetics, was used in some experimentation. This not only violates standard medical ethics, but also raises the question whether the family should have gained monetary compensation for the HeLa discovery.

Due to the commercialization of HeLa and the profit pharmaceutical companies made, a share of monetary compensation would have been the most economically justified approach to recognizing Henrietta Lacks' indirect but seemingly important contribution to medicine today. In the novel, Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' daughter, allegedly states, ""'People always gonna be makin money from them cells, nothing we can do about that. But we not gonna get any of it'""(Skloot, pg. 167). It is evident that the open availability of cell lines is critical for research benefiting humanity, but consent for the use of cell lines for research should be asked to the individual first. Henrietta Lacks did not give consent to have her tissue extracted or for her cells to be used for various methods of research, but it should have been asked since cells contain extremely personal information such as DNA. Pharmaceutical companies are profiting from HeLa, therefore, it is only right for the Lacks family to gain some sort of compensation for their indirect but revolutionary contribution. There should be open availability of cell lines if formal consent is given, and compensation should be given for the contribution. Compensation could be given from the government, shares of medical or pharmaceutical organizations, or institutions that profited from the research, such as Johns Hopkins.",

The argument I present draws on ethical distinctions from the first four chapters of The Fundamentals of Ethics.

Social media, as a platform for self-presentation, often encourages individuals to showcase their most positive experiences, achievements, and aesthetically pleasing moments. This tendency can create a distorted perception of what a good life entails, as it prioritizes and magnifies these positive aspects while omitting the challenges, setbacks, and mundane realities of everyday life.

From a deontological standpoint, the ethical duty of truthfulness is compromised when individuals selectively curate their lives on social media. Deontology emphasizes adherence to moral duties and principles. By presenting a skewed version of reality, users may violate the duty to honesty and contribute to a collective illusion of an idealized good life.

Utilitarian considerations also play a role in my argument. The impact of social media on mental health, self-esteem, and societal well-being is substantial. The pursuit of validation through likes and comments can lead to negative consequences for individuals, contributing to a utilitarian calculus where overall happiness is diminished. The constant exposure to idealized lifestyles may foster dissatisfaction and foster social comparison.

Discussing this viewpoint with a friend revealed divergent opinions. While they acknowledged the potential for distortion on social media, they argued that users have agency in curating their feeds and recognizing the selective nature of online portrayals. This objection prompted a reconsideration of my argument, emphasizing the collective impact of societal norms perpetuated by social media platforms.

In response to objections, I refined my argument to acknowledge individual agency while highlighting the broader societal implications. My friend's perspective also underscored the need for media literacy and critical engagement to navigate the nuanced landscape of social media representation.

The conversation highlighted the complexity of the issue, with my friend contending that social media serves as a valuable tool for connection, inspiration, and positive sharing. While I acknowledged these positive aspects, my argument stressed the ethical responsibility of users to present a more balanced and authentic view of their lives.

In conclusion, the examination of Shafer-Landau's ""Social Media"" case, coupled with ethical frameworks from The Fundamentals of Ethics, leads me to assert that social media indeed provides a distorted view of what constitutes a good life. Drawing on deontological and utilitarian perspectives, the argument underscores the ethical responsibilities associated with online self-presentation. The conversation with my friend illuminated the need for a nuanced understanding, emphasizing individual agency and societal impact in navigating the complexities of social media representation.","ChatGPT, and I provided these instructions:

Most people report discontent when using social media, and their criticisms can be found justified about it. I believe that the discontent when using social media is more attributed to our brains not being evolved properly to handle social media and the implications it has. Usually, people who use social media tend to attribute meaningless numbers to some sort of intrinsic value they have. This creates a sort of disconnect from reality and people fail to realize that numbers are just numbers at the end of the day. Therefore, it is more about the people themselves who use social media and what they make of it. Social media does give a distorted view of what constitutes a good life. Due to the innate human nature of wanting to show off the best part of ourselves like we would in everyday life, unrealistic expectations are born. It fosters a sort of unhealthy idealization that is difficult to revert once set in.

I talked to a friend about my answer and he said that he agrees with everything I put in and that I explained what he would have put pretty well. He also added that social media creates a sort of ""positive feedback loop, similar in some ways to addiction.""Similar in some ways to addiction being that when you post something, you are validated with likes and it rewards your brain with chemicals such as dopamine. As I have also explained before, it is a vicious cycle where people get used to the ""new normal""and only seek more, therefore leading to nearly infinite levels of unhappiness as people strive for more. Striving for more is not always a bad thing, it is good to set new goals to challenge yourself to do better. However, there is a fine line between challenging yourself for the better and challenging yourself in an unhealthy fashion. With social media, it is definitely easy to fall into the latter and neglect personal needs such as health only for the meaningless number on the screen. I also agree with this statement because this positive feedback loop occurs in our underdeveloped minds.

Social media addiction is more of a case against desire theory due to it being an example of a situation where constant fulfillment of wants leads them down the wrong path. Because people keep getting what they want they become conditioned to the new normal, so they always want more, and that creates an empty feeling for them as it continues. To add on, social media addiction is also an example of a hedonism gone wrong. This is when people tend to value the pleasure they get for the likes more than anything else, and as I've explained before, neglect their own personal health.

As people strive to post only the best versions of themselves and nothing else, they start to become irrelevant and unrelatable to others with their seemingly perfect life. The average person has daily struggles and seems to assume that there is nothing going on ""behind the scenes""for the person posting on social media. Due to this, they will also start comparing themselves to the social media poster which is a grave mistake and leads to a massive loss in self confidence and an increased risk of depression. Meanwhile, the person behind the camera may not be living the happy life that they are portraying on social media. They may feel just as inadequate as the average person in this example and compare themselves to other influencers on social media that may have the same life or a better life to them, adding to another vicious cycle of comparing themselves with each other, seeing and being jealous at the seemingly perfect life they live.

Not only can social media addiction cause personal problems for the person it can also create a rift in their relationships. They will become unfortunate subjects to envy from everyone around them that don't know what their life is truly like, including their own friends and family. Let's say someone on social media is posting about how much money they have and they are always ""flexing""(or showing off) their new lamborghini. Anyone who does not own a lamborghini will undoubtedly get jealous, whether it be friends and family. They may use their close status to the person to ask for a loan of sorts or this person may attract friends that are only there for the money and did not know them beforehand. To add on, in the worst case scenario, anyone may try to steal the lamborghini so they can have it for themselves, though this is rare and is unlikely to happen.

In this essay, I have confidently established that social media addiction can definitely cause problems for everyone involved. This is mainly due to the fact that our brains are not developed enough to deal with the sudden validation we get from social media. We tend to attribute meaning to meaningless numbers and sacrifice our own well-being and happiness in cases to see those numbers go up. Additionally, social media addiction can lead to dramatic decreases in self confidence as people see each other on social media seemingly have a much better life than them. It also invites toxic relationships with acquaintances/friends/family. The people involved may not be with the social media poster for they really are; instead they may only be with the person for the money or fame they can provide, which is also an unfortunate epidemic in today's society and a result of social media bringing the worst out of the human race.",

The central question posed is whether individuals can bring about societal change in a world governed by the pervasive ""profit-seeking logic"" of capitalism. Through their distinct perspectives, Klein and Giridharadas offer insights into the challenges and possibilities inherent in addressing societal issues within the confines of profit-driven systems.

To commence the exploration, it is crucial to establish a common understanding of key terms. ""Societal change"" refers to transformations at the collective level, encompassing shifts in social, economic, and political structures that impact communities on a broader scale. Klein contends that grappling with the chaotic consequences of climate change is deemed more acceptable by some than challenging the very foundations of capitalism's growth-centric and profit-oriented logic (224).

The term ""profit-seeking logic"" encapsulates the fundamental principles that guide capitalist systems, emphasizing growth and the pursuit of financial gains as paramount. Both authors scrutinize this logic, with Giridharadas specifically critiquing the role of ""thought leaders."" He argues that these figures perpetuate watered-down theories of change, focusing on personal and depoliticized solutions rather than challenging the systemic aspects of profit-driven capitalism (120).

In contemplating the possibility of individuals effecting societal change within this profit-centric paradigm, the scope of changes under consideration becomes vital. The authors, in their respective essays, direct attention to the pressing issues of climate change and the need for a transformative approach to capitalism.

Klein, echoing the sentiment that changing the climate is perceived as more acceptable than altering capitalist logic, suggests a reluctance to confront the root causes of environmental degradation. On the other hand, Giridharadas scrutinizes the influence of thought leaders in perpetuating a status quo that resists systemic change. He contends that individuals' efforts, often limited to personal, ""zoomed-in"" solutions, may fall short in addressing the broader societal issues.

The authors present a nuanced view of individual agency within the confines of profit-seeking logic. Klein's perspective implies a formidable challenge in changing the system itself, as the inertia of capitalism resists transformation. Giridharadas, while critical of thought leaders, acknowledges the potential for individuals to bridge personal solutions with broader societal efforts.

In conclusion, the essays prompt an examination of the complexities surrounding societal change within a profit-driven world. While both Klein and Giridharadas offer critiques of the existing paradigm, the question remains open-ended. The possibility of individuals effecting transformative change within a profit-driven system is contingent on navigating the tensions between personal and systemic solutions, a challenge that requires further exploration.","ChatGPT.

To add on, both texts come to a consensus about how elites are only ""profit-seeking""in terms of money and not the overall well-being of society. Profit-seeking being the antithesis of societal change depending on the circumstances. People who are profit-seeking are only seeking a means of net profit gain of cash. In various cases this does not always mean that they would be geared towards positive societal change if it meant that they had any money to lose along the way. Despite change seeming hopeless and powerless if it means elites cannot make more money with said proposal, it is definitely possible for individuals to accomplish societal change even within a world governed by profit-seeking logic. However, the chances are slim and it won't be happening anytime soon.

Societal change is going to be challenging due to the fact that it will be difficult to come up with a solution that can effectively solve the problem at hand. The majority of solutions that tend to be accepted by the elites of society are those that are not systematic and not from critics. Critics speak of big issues but do not have much to say on how to solve them. Giridharadas elaborates on what the average critic might have done in this issue, which is to ""speak of problems rather than easy solutions, and of challenging power and systems,""(88). Meanwhile, Klein gives an example of a solution that a critic may propose regarding climate change. On the other hand, she also explains what needs to change with her solution such as ""changing how much energy we actually use: how often we drive, how often we fly, whether our food has to be flown to get to us, whether the goods we buy are built to last or to be replaced in two years, how large our homes are. And these are the sorts of policies that have been neglected so far,""(Klein 225). In the quote, she gives an exact list of what ""consuming less""actually means since there might be confusion there. The inclusion of the last sentence in the quote also highlights that Klein knows herself that the solution is one that someone such as a critic may think of, even though it's not explicitly stated; which is most likely why it has been rejected by elites and neglected. The proposal that Klein stated does not have any easy solutions like a thought leader's ideas would; she lays out a complicated fix that she states the implications for. Additionally, it speaks of challenging power and systems such as climate change and the elites' rejection of the proposal. Giridharadas' contribution serves to bring context to Klein's hypothetical solution and give an idea on why it may be rejected, classifying people who propose such solutions to be critics and have their ideas dismissed. At this point in the profit-seeking climate, it seems like solutions one can offer are only of some similarity to what a critic would propose.

Not only is climate change getting worse at an alarming rate, any attempts to actually solve it are being sabotaged by people with a mindset similar to ""thought leaders""hired by elites. Usually, when trying to solve big societal issues that are problematic for elites, thought leaders come up with insights that serve to give the elites some peace of mind. They are completely favored by elites due to their uncanny ability to offer ""watered-down theories of change that are personal, individual, depoliticized,""(Giridharadas 120). Essentially, they are able to take an issue and offer theories for change which leave the elites with little to sacrifice. Their solutions will involve picking at minor details in the problems themselves unrelated to politics and big power systems so the elites can have peace of mind and not be wholly involved. Even so, these insights may only make the problem worse in the long run as Klein will demonstrate. Klein states an example of this ""solution""by discussing a loophole that allowed countries to report lower emission readings in their specific country when emissions weren't actually going down on a global scale. The loophole was to say that emissions were decreasing in certain countries, meanwhile they were merely using the practice of free trade to have factories built in other foreign countries. This particular solution ""has created a vastly distorted picture of the drivers of global emissions. It has allowed rapidly de-industrializing wealthy states to claim that their emissions have stabilized or even gone down when, in fact, the emissions embedded in their consumption have soared during the free trade era,""(Klein 217). To clarify, it is impossible to tell if actual thought leaders came up with the idea of using this as a loophole to record a reduction in emissions. On the other hand, it makes the problem act detached from the target countries. The distorted picture that is created of global emissions is also harmful and only seeks to make climate change worse. The detached, personal, and depoliticized nature of the solutions that thought leaders propose on a global phenomenon such as climate change only have the effect of barely doing anything or making the solution worse. To add on, thought leaders are mainly preferred by elites when it comes to any problem, big or small. Therefore with the abundance of thought leaders having a say in societal issues, societal change is once again unlikely.

Societal change will also not be likely due to an apparent apathy from elites and common folk towards finding solutions that work and solutions that can benefit people overall. People would rather live with the issues than find a solution to them since it would require a large amount of effort to set and regulate. To add on, this apathy can have larger implications in the future due to society's unwillingness to fix rising issues. If there is no one speaking out about it, it will only continue to rise and have disastrous implications. Giridharadas hints at the apathy by discussing an essay written by Andrew Zolli of MarketWorld which ""argued that the world should focus less on rooting out its biggest problems, including poverty and climate change, and more on living with them,""(Giridharadas 89). Through living with these issues and not doing anything about it, society develops an unhealthy habit of ignoring problems until they explode; which is likely to happen to climate change in the future. A peculiar detail to note is that Giridharadas does not mention money anywhere before or after the selected text. This apparent apathy seems to not only be the result of people geared towards making as much money as possible: it also seems to be from people that only focus on remedying and ignoring the problem for as long as they possibly can. By finding out that the apathy is not only caused by people always seeking a profit, it can be easier to fight. In an attempt to combat this apathy, Klein argues that change will not happen if people do not realize the extent of how devastating climate change is and seek effective courses of action. To jolt people into realizing how harmful the apathy is, she gives a dramatic statement about how destabilizing the health of our planet is more natural than changing the fundamental core of an economic system to improve the wellbeing of the planet for the future. As for the majority of society, ""changing the earth's climate in ways that will be chaotic and disastrous is easier to accept than the prospect of changing the fundamental, growth-based, profit-seeking logic of capitalism. We probably shouldn't be surprised that some climate scientists are a little spooked by the radical implications of their own research,""(Klein 224). By saying how changing the climate of the Earth is easier to do than to change the profit-seeking logic of capitalism, Klein makes the whole gravity of the situation stand out to her audience. Due to the simplification of the situation, it is easier to put into perspective how harmful the apathy is for the state of the planet. Anyone would be able to recognize that it is common sense for humans as a species to maintain Earth in a comfortable state so future generations can live safely without much hassle. Klein also does not fail to mention that climate scientists are ""spooked""by the results of their research. Revealing the surprise of the scientists adds to the sense of urgency that she meant to give with the selected text. On the contrary, Klein's message of urgency in the text is not enough to bring a remarkable reduction in the overall apathy towards changing the world against climate change. It is unlikely that the apathy which is discouraging societal change will reduce in the future due to the nature of society and people understandably having bigger issues in their own personal lives to worry about such as their work and trying to earn enough money to have a decent life, meanwhile the elites cannot find an effective solution that would be a win-win for them and the planet.

Societal change is unlikely to happen, and it has been supported with evidence from Giridharadas and Klein. By effectively putting these two authors together and synthesizing their works, ample reasons come to light about why societal change is unlikely. Each author has their original insights of societal change. However, when their original ideas are combined, they become a part of bigger ideas that strengthen each others' claims. Giridharadas broadens the scope of not only focusing on climate change but of other issues in society and illustrates knowledgeable depth of societal issues by showing the concept of what a ""thought leader""and ""critic""are. Klein gives perfectly fit examples of the criteria for a thought leader and critic when discussing the issue of climate change. Both also discuss apathy and how that is an issue while having different approaches, as Giridharadas gives context for it in his work while Klein makes an effort to fight the apathy. Overall climate change is a humongous issue that will take meticulous study and research over time to truly reduce, added on with the growing negligence and impatience towards making an effort to solve climate change, societal change is unlikely to happen in the near future.",

In the realm of contemporary technological advancements, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era, reshaping our world in profound ways. This essay delves into the philosophy of AI, examining its transformative impact, ethical considerations, and the delicate balance between regulation and progress. While acknowledging the considerable benefits AI has bestowed upon society, I argue for stringent regulation, particularly in limiting the autonomous capabilities of AI systems, as a means to ensure ethical use and prevent potential harms.

The advent of AI has undeniably catalyzed a technological renaissance, revolutionizing industries and augmenting human capabilities. In healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics have enhanced accuracy, expediting disease detection and treatment. AI's prowess in data analysis has bolstered fields like finance, improving risk assessment and decision-making. Additionally, AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks ranging from language translation to image recognition, ushering in unprecedented efficiency and convenience.

However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the autonomy AI possesses raises ethical concerns. Unbridled AI autonomy poses risks, especially in contexts where decisions impact human lives. The lack of transparency in complex AI algorithms can lead to biased outcomes, perpetuating societal inequalities. For instance, in the criminal justice system, AI predictions have been criticized for unfairly targeting certain demographics. Furthermore, AI's potential to autonomously generate content, including code, raises concerns about security and accountability.

To strike a delicate balance between technological advancement and ethical considerations, a robust regulatory framework is imperative. While AI's capacity to automate tasks is impressive, unregulated autonomy poses risks to human autonomy and livelihoods. Striking this balance requires meticulous oversight to ensure that AI aligns with ethical principles, rather than becoming a tool that replaces human agency. Governments must establish clear guidelines on the use of AI, restricting its autonomy in certain domains to safeguard against unintended consequences.

Here lies a point of contention. Many argue that allowing AI to fully automate tasks, including coding and generating new AI models, can boost efficiency and innovation. However, my stance contends that such capabilities should be tempered by regulation. Unfettered AI autonomy in job sectors may lead to mass unemployment, as humans are displaced by machines. History teaches us that technological progress must be accompanied by prudent societal safeguards to prevent unintended consequences.

Real-life examples illuminate the potential dangers of unregulated AI autonomy. In finance, algorithmic trading, driven by autonomous AI systems, has been implicated in market crashes, emphasizing the need for regulatory constraints. In the realm of cybersecurity, AI with unchecked autonomy could be manipulated to unleash destructive cyber-attacks, potentially causing catastrophic damage. The risks are not hypothetical; they underscore the urgency of establishing ethical boundaries.

In conclusion, the philosophy of AI transcends technological marvels and necessitates careful consideration of its ethical implications. While AI has undeniably improved countless aspects of our lives, the potential for harm looms large. My thesis advocates for a future where AI continues to be a force for good, but under the watchful eyes of stringent regulations. By limiting AI autonomy, particularly in domains that directly impact human lives, we can ensure a harmonious integration of technology and ethics, avoiding the pitfalls of unbridled progress. The road ahead demands vigilance, as we navigate the uncharted waters of an AI-driven future, striving for innovation within the bounds of ethical responsibility.","write a 5-10 page essay about the philosophy of ai, the pros and cons, and how ai can be used ethically/or used for bad. give a perspective on how ai has shaped the world and what it can be used for in the future. write it in the style of a 2nd year english student who has adequate writing skills, and has perfect grammar, however your writing style can be verbose at times. make the verbosity very unnoticeable except to the trained eye (which can be an english professor). your thesis is that ai has changed the world for the better and can continue to do so, however you also believe on strictly regulating ai on what it can say or do, such as limiting how well it can code/generate ai, which many people may not agree with you on. give real life examples of how ai having these abilities can be dangerous. you are still pro-ai overall but believe the government needs to heavily regulate it to be a helping tool. you believe it should not be something that does people's jobs for them, essentially. reflect this in one or two paragraphs in the essay"

This story imagines a day in the life of Shakespeare, blending historical facts with creative liberties, much like how Shakespeare himself intertwined history with fiction in his plays.

In the bustling streets of London, circa 1599, William Shakespeare, in his mid-thirties, strolled with a contemplative air. The morning mist still lingered, casting a soft glow over the timber-framed buildings. Shakespeare, a playwright already gaining recognition, was on his way to the Globe Theatre, the venue that had become the crucible for his creativity.

As he walked, his mind was a whirlwind of characters and dialogues, each vying for attention. Shakespeare was working on what would become one of his most famous tragedies, ""Hamlet."" The character of Hamlet, a prince torn by moral dilemmas and existential questions, fascinated Shakespeare. He pondered over the famous soliloquy, ""To be, or not to be,"" contemplating the depth of human emotions and the complexities of life and death.

Reaching the Globe, Shakespeare was greeted by the actors, who were eagerly awaiting the new script. He had a special bond with his troupe, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. They respected his genius and trusted his vision, even when his ideas seemed unconventional. As he handed them the latest draft of ""Hamlet,"" the actors were immediately absorbed, sensing the gravity of this new play.

Throughout the day, Shakespeare was deeply involved in the rehearsals. He guided the actors through the nuances of their characters, often jumping in to demonstrate a gesture or a tone of voice. His passion for theater was infectious, and the entire troupe worked with a fervor, driven by his energy.

As evening approached, Shakespeare took a break and walked along the River Thames. He reflected on his journey from Stratford-upon-Avon to London. He had left his family behind to pursue his dreams, a decision that weighed heavily on him. However, his love for the written word and the stage was a calling he could not ignore. He thought about his wife, Anne Hathaway, and his children, wondering how they were faring in his absence.

Returning to the Globe, Shakespeare watched as the sun set behind the theater. The actors were still practicing, their voices echoing in the empty auditorium. He felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. His plays were not just entertainment; they were reflections on human nature, society, and the universe.

That night, after the rehearsals, Shakespeare sat alone in his room, lit by the flickering candlelight. He picked up his quill and continued writing. The words flowed from him effortlessly, as if he were merely a conduit for some divine inspiration.

In this imagined day, Shakespeare's life was a testament to his enduring legacy. He was more than a playwright; he was a visionary who captured the essence of humanity in his works. His plays, written over four centuries ago, still resonate with audiences today, a true mark of his genius.",Write in the Fashion of a 12th-grade student. I used ChatGPT to generate this essay.

8564,2- Written by me but grammar was corrected by AI,Compare Baroque music with Traditional Chinese music. Use class material and online resources to support your claim.,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by AI,98,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,57,0.56,56.6,"Baroque music and traditional Chinese music present a compelling comparison of two contrasting musical traditions. Examining the roles of composers, performers, and audiences in each tradition allows us to better understand their cultural contexts and musical functions. For this analysis, I have chosen Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 as an example of Baroque music, and a traditional Chinese Guqin solo piece, ""Flowing Water,"" as an example of traditional Chinese music.

Baroque music and traditional Chinese music are two highly distinct styles of music that emerged from different parts of the world. Baroque music originated in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, while traditional Chinese music can be traced back to ancient China. Despite their differences in origin, Baroque and Chinese traditional music share some similarities in terms of their principles of voice leading. In Baroque music, the voice-leading practice aims to promote the perceptual independence of different musical voices by avoiding parallel octaves between independent parts. Similarly, in traditional Chinese music, abrupt changes of timbre produced by instruments such as the dizi flute are used to create partial segregation between musical parts, promoting perceptual independence.

In Baroque music, composers played a significant role in the creation and dissemination of their works. They typically wrote their compositions for specific events, such as church services and court performances. Additionally, Baroque music is characterized by its ornate and intricate melodies, use of counterpoint, and focus on the individual voices within an ensemble. Bach, for instance, composed the Brandenburg Concertos for a specific patron, demonstrating the close relationship between composers and their patrons. In traditional Chinese music, the role of the composer varies. In some cases, like the Guqin repertoire, pieces were written down in a specialized notation system called ""jianzi pu."" However, many pieces were also transmitted orally and aurally, with a focus on preserving the music's essence rather than strict adherence to a written score.

Baroque music performers are often classically trained musicians who follow the composer's written score, with some room for ornamentation and interpretation. In Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, the performers are required to execute complex counterpoints and virtuosic solos, showcasing their technical skills. In traditional Chinese music, performers are also highly skilled, but the emphasis is on expressing the music's emotional content and creating an intimate connection with the audience. Performers of the Guqin, for example, are expected to convey the subtle nuances of the music through their mastery of the instrument's unique techniques and ornamentations.

The audiences for Baroque music were primarily upper-class individuals who attended performances in formal settings, such as courts or churches. They were expected to sit quietly and appreciate the music, with little to no direct participation. In contrast, traditional Chinese music was enjoyed by a broader range of audiences, including both the elite and the general population. Performances could take place in private homes, teahouses, or outdoor settings, and audience members were often more actively engaged, providing feedback or even participating in the performance through singing or recitation.

In comparing the meter of Baroque and traditional Chinese music, we find distinct differences. Baroque music, exemplified by Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, often employs a consistent meter throughout each movement. This provides a sense of structure and stability to the music. Conversely, traditional Chinese music displays more fluidity, with meters and rhythmic structures that mimic the natural flow of speech or environmental sounds. This flexibility allows for greater expressiveness and connection to the music's emotional content.

Regarding the mode, Baroque music typically utilizes major and minor modes, which provide harmonic progressions and modulations that contribute to the music's emotional depth. Traditional Chinese music, on the other hand, is based on a pentatonic scale system, with various modes corresponding to the piece's intended mood or context. This modal approach creates a unique tonal color and atmosphere in traditional Chinese music that is distinct from its Western counterparts.

When examining the use of musical devices, Baroque music is known for its rich textures and intricate structures created through techniques such as counterpoint, imitation, and sequence. In contrast, traditional Chinese music places a greater emphasis on melody and the application of ornamentation and expressive techniques to convey emotions and imagery. This focus on melodic expression results in a more intimate and evocative musical experience.

In terms of texture, Baroque music is characterized by its polyphonic nature, with multiple voices and independent melodic lines woven together to create complex layers of sound. Traditional Chinese music, particularly in solo pieces like ""Flowing Water,"" tends to be monophonic, featuring a single melodic line embellished by ornamentation and supported by the instrument's resonance, which provides an underlying sense of harmony. This monophonic texture is often perceived as more meditative and introspective compared to the dense polyphony of Baroque music.

Lastly, when comparing the instrumentation of these two traditions, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 showcases a diverse ensemble, including strings, harpsichord, and flute. This varied instrumentation contributes to the richness and complexity of the Baroque sound. Traditional Chinese music, in contrast, employs a wide range of instruments, such as the Guqin and Erhu, which are designed to evoke specific emotions or imitate natural sounds. The unique timbres of these instruments further distinguish traditional Chinese music from Western classical traditions.

Despite their distinct origins and approaches to composition, performance, and audience engagement, both traditions share a commitment to expressing emotion and creating unique musical experiences. The intricate and polyphonic textures of Baroque music, as exemplified by Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, showcase the technical prowess of performers and the complexity of Western classical music. In contrast, the monophonic and contemplative nature of traditional Chinese music, such as the Guqin solo piece ""Flowing Water,"" emphasizes the intimate connection between performer and audience, as well as the evocative power of melody and ornamentation. By exploring these contrasting traditions, we gain a deeper appreciation for the variety of musical expressions that exist across the world and the myriad ways in which music can touch our hearts and minds.",I used GPT 3.5 to fix my grammar.
1196,1- Entirely written by me,I forgot what it was exactly but we were provided a couple of documents on capitalism and were tasked to create an argument based on what we read. In this case I was arguing that capitalism is the downfall of democracy because companies have too much control over the public opinion and government.,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,57.41,99.97,23.14,"Democracy, as defined by the Greeks, is ""rule by the people."" The people have the power to choose their leaders and reform the system. The United States is the role model of democracy for the modern era; however, it has morphed into an oligarchy to benefit solely wealthy. In chapter 4 of Winner Takes All, ""The Critic and the Thought Leader,"" Anand Giridharadas argues that plutocrats use thought leaders to profit even more from the general public. In ""The New Face of Capitalism,"" Rick Wartzman argues that the triumph of Wal-Mart is a transparent image that democracy no longer exists in the United States. The constant abuse of the general public by plutocrats is a brutal reminder of how the United States no longer is ruled by the people but rather plutocrats.

Wal-Mart is regarded as the face of capitalism today. This face has been leading the charge of ""deunionizing"" crippling the ability for workers to be able to fight back against their executive overlords. During the industrial age, workers were able to band together to reform inhumane working conditions and expectations set by corporations. Labor Unions were able to provide support to these workers during this time. With the help of labor unions, workers were ready to go on strike without sacrificing their livelihoods to make the change. Today, it is apparent that corporations want to take their ability to do just that. ""'Deunionization,' Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute has written, 'has strengthened the hands of employers and undercut the ability of low- and middle-wage workers to have good jobs and economic security.'"" (Wartzman, 513). The downfall of organized labor has cost the employees their benefits and, ultimately, their freedom to make choices. Without a secure path to success, these workers are in a vicious cycle of feeding even more money to the large corporations that have put them in this situation. Thought leaders have made this situation worse by making the general public blame themselves for the conditions they are in. Thought leaders promote the idea that an issue will fix itself if the individual fixes themselves in a certain way. Rather than looking at the more significant picture, individuals scrutinize themselves for not being good enough to survive today. ""[Thought leaders] are taking on issues that can easily be regarded as political and systematic...but using the power of their thoughts to cause us to zoom in and think smaller...They want us to focus on his vulnerability, not his wage."" (Girdharadas, 100). Rather than it being the fault of executives screwing the employees, it is the employee who is responsible. Thought leaders are masters at making issues seem a lot more bearable than they are. Layoffs and injustice in the workplace could be solved easily with a political argument that favors the general public. However, the issue is neglected, the responsibility is pushed onto the victim to fix themselves in the toxic environment. Amy Cuddy fed the fire by promoting power poses. Rather than changing the system of inequality and sexism, individuals who feel threatened could improve themselves to get themselves out of a hole. This individualized outlook on life is a democracy. The power should be given to the general public to make changes to benefit themselves, but instead, given to plutocrats.

With power stripped away from the ordinary people, they now rely on plutocrats. They do the bidding of plutocrats to receive aid but have been neglected and further drained of their rights. They are consistently used to increase the profits of plutocrats without regard to their rights. The perfect example of this is Wal-Mart, while it may seem like they are trying to help the public by doing as much as possible to save them money, they compromise 1.3 million employees to achieve this goal. ""The idea was that by doing absolutely everything possible to minimize costs, Wal-Mart would be able to deliver consistently low prices to its customers, giving hardworking people more money to spend on other things,"" (Wartzman, 508). The choice to save money at Wal-Mart and go out to purchase other goods is a facade. Wal-Mart reducing its prices makes it possible for them to pay their workers less. Doing so force its workers to come back to Wal-Mart to purchase their goods because no other place offers the same price. This cycle of funnelling money back into themselves fuels their profits and milks their employees even more. On the other spectrum, a thought leader named Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist who focuses on prejudice and inequality chose to lie to her audience to earn money for her research. ""Members of the 'replication movement"" in social psychology, who have been pushing for more rigorous standards of double-checking, retested her findings and reported the effect of posing on hormones to be nonexistent while acknowledging some impact on people's self-reported feelings."" While the general public saw Cuddy as someone they could rely on; her choice was to lie to them to earn as much money as possible. The illusion of choice is also prominent in politicians. While it seems as if there are many candidates to vote for, ordinary people have no say in their elections. Plutocrats are the ones promoting and providing funds to these politicians. It is not uncommon for the elected candidate to walk into the oval office and completely throw out the agenda they had promised the general public to favor plutocrats. Politicians receive money from plutocrats and use that money to promote themselves. When the politician's goal is achieved, such as acquiring a specific position in the government, they make efforts to help the plutocrats instead of the general public. Using the general public for personal gain is the common link between all three instances. Wal-Mart chooses to underpay their workers so they can only afford Wal-Mart goods, politicians reforming the country benefit the plutocrats, and thought leaders who have no moral implications lie to earn money. If democracy is about the people, how is it possible that the plutocrats are continually using the general public? Reform needs to occur, but the general public is now too reliant on plutocrats to save democracy.

In this society, to create change, an individual must start with an idea. To be heard, the individual must have wealth and status. However, plutocrats and Walmart are preventing the general public from meeting either requirement to initiate change. The 1.3 million workers at Walmart are suffering workers because they aren't able to move up to other social classes to gain status or wealth in society because plutocrats have already gutted support from Labor Unions. ""Some Wal-Mart managers tried to make conditions insufferable for their highest-paid employees so that they'd quit and could be replaced by others earning less."" (Wartzman, 509). Walmart is keen on getting rid of the workers at are getting paid more to make room for people who can't argue with their salary because their livelihood depends on this job. Walmart is toeing the line between democracy and capitalism by trying to monopolize low-class workers by trapping these workers in their system. This monopoly prevents all of their employees, who are suffering from their business tactics, from participating in political reform. Plutocrats are doing the same by monopolizing the marketplace for ideas. They gave ""rise to watered-down theories of change that are personal, individual, depoliticized, respectful of the status quo and the system, and not in the least bit disruptive."" (Giridharadasm, 120). Plutocrats, using thought leaders, choose which direct society and politics go because they control the majority of people's ideas by turning major issues into self-improvement tips. They want to be the only producers of ideas. These two monopolies on the general public's minds and the lives of lower-class workers are the polar opposite of what represents democracy. In 1890 the government already proved that they are against monopolies passing the Sherman Antitrust Act which was to limit monopolies. Preventing the creation of opinions that oppose them and preventing lower-class workers from making an impact on society creates a government that serves only plutocrats.¬†

As the Greeks have defined it, democracy is about the power to the people. However, it is no longer the case for the United States. The push for ""de-unionization"" has crippled the ability of the suffering workers to make impactful changes to the system like the ones made during the industrial age in the 1930's to the 1960s. No longer are individuals able to find others similar to them because everyone is unique. Everyone has their issues, and the reason why victims are in the situation they are in right now is that they haven't improved enough yet. This toxic message is promoted by thought leaders and plutocrats to ensure people do not change the system and only themselves. Companies are continually looking for ways to optimize their profits no matter the cost, and the unfortunate victims of this are the employees of such companies. Companies are willing to sacrifice the lives of their workers, and thought leaders are eager to ruin their credibility to earn a little more money. Democracy and capitalism do not go well together as one promotes the ability for people to make a change, and the other benefits people with money. Power will automatically land in the lands of individuals with the most influence. Capitalism supports the idea that some individuals will be more successful than others. However, in today's society, the wealth gap has grown so large it has given those who are in the upper echelon of wealth far more significant influence on the government than the rest. With power stripped from the general public, their reliance on these plutocrats is perpetually increasing, and their lives monopolized by plutocrats, democracy is looking closer to a pipe dream rather than a reality.",

As art evolves, it inspires a change in technology. As technology evolves, new subjects and methods of creating art evolve. In the current day, technology and art have grown to the point where growth in technology has spawned a new artist: Artificial Intelligence programs. Artificial Intelligence is a large field in Computer Science with the goal of creating systems that are able to perform a given task given certain input data. With the recent spark of AI technologies, Artificial Intelligence has affected the creation of art by allowing artists to create images using AI and by allowing artists to create art exhibits and experiences using AI. Artificial intelligence has broadened the horizons of art, but has also come with its own set of challenges particularly regarding the ethics of AI art and the question of if the output of AI can be considered art. These challenges are all a part of the new paths paved by the evolution of technologies behind AI that will push art and technology into the next century.

Before analyzing Artificial Intelligence as a new form of creating and being art, there is one important question that must be answered: What is art? The answer to this question is not as simple as the question itself. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes that any definition of art must include notes about aesthetic, meaning, and cultural impact. A chapter pertaining to art theory in Undergraduate Research in Art covers semiotics, iconography, and visual language as different lenses that art may be interpreted through. This lends itself to the definition of art in the sense that although an artist may have a particular intention in creating a piece of art, there are still many ways which the art can be interpreted or impact its audience. In this chapter, artists note that despite their intentions with their pieces, their art ""will be seen by others and their optics, histories, and visual cultural experiences will play a major part in how they interpret and engage with [their] work""(Judge et al. 121). This fact is inherent to the definition of art and thus art must be considered as something that is very up to interpretation to each viewer of a piece.

This broad definition of art provides a great landing platform for the answer to the question: Can Artificial Intelligence create art? To answer this question, the extent to which Artificial Intelligence can create art must be dissected. Artificial Intelligence is output, referred to as intelligence, from a machine or computer program that was created by a human or the machine or computer program itself (Wu et al. 169). In order for Artificial Intelligence to create art, it must be trained in one way or another to do so using machine learning. Early Artificial Intelligence programs created to generate art were trained using neural networks. A neural network is a method of training Artificial Intelligence which stands out for the fact that the training process replicates the way that humans and other animals learn to do things (Wu et al. 169). Although neural networks imitate the way that humans learn, it is not the most efficient process to train Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, newer Artificial Intelligence programs that are designed to create art are trained using deep learning. Deep learning is an evolution of neural networks, as it uses both neural networks and large sets of data to produce an output that could seamlessly fit into its sample data.

The final layer of algorithms within Art Artificial Intelligence is called generative adversarial networks, or GAN (Wu et al. 169). Wu notes that the artistic outputs of GANs were ""so well-received that it quickly became a new creative medium or method""(Wu et al. 169). Their accurate artistic outputs were so effective that GANs became a new art medium, but how do they work? GANs can be explained as somewhere between a cat-and-mouse game and spot-the-difference. The best way to explain GAN is with an example. Modern Artificial Intelligence designed to generate art is trained on large relevant datasets. If there is an Artificial Intelligence tasked with creating a contemporary piece of abstract art, then the Artificial Intelligence will contain a large set of images of contemporary pieces of abstract art. When the user wants this Artificial Intelligence to create a contemporary piece of abstract art, the generative end of the GAN contained in the program will generate its resulting piece of art for the user. Next, the discriminator end of the program will try to detect if the piece it is given is not from the sample data. If the resulting piece passes the discriminator test, then the piece that the Artificial Intelligence generated is deemed of good enough quality to pass onto the user. Otherwise, the generator and discriminator continue their game until they can pass a high-quality output to the user.

If the programmer of the Artificial Intelligence is the artist, then each artist can customize the general GAN structure to fit their artistic needs by altering the dataset that they feed to the Artificial Intelligence or by altering the parameters that the GAN takes. Through these practices, many artists can utilize a similar algorithm or program structure to create drastically different pieces of art. Artist Kyle McDonald has created his own Artificial Intelligence programs to create art pieces and interactive art exhibits. McDonald notes that his pieces begin with technique with technology, stating, ""I kind of manipulate and explore that tech until I find something that is compelling to me""(Caramiaux et al. 9). In this sense, McDonald uses the Artificial Intelligence algorithm as his artistic medium. Artificial Intelligence algorithms therefore can be the method of producing art. Through analysis of McDonald's use of Artificial Intelligence, the conclusion can be drawn that Artificial Intelligence can be used as a medium by an artist to create art. McDonald would be the artist who creates art while using Artificial Intelligence. Anna Ridler is another artist who uses Artificial Intelligence to create art particularly with datasets. Ridler notes that as the programmer and artist, she must ""decide [...] when it is the moment, when you stop the training""(Caramiaux et al. 10). Riddler is referring to the process of training the GAN of the Artificial Intelligence algorithm on a specific dataset. Stopping training too early can result in an output that hardly resembles the data it was trained on, while stopping training too late can result in works that too closely mimic a specific art style and thus lose the particular touch that a programmer and artist may add to the algorithm. Both McDonald and Ridler detail how they put their artistic spin on their Artificial Intelligence algorithms to create work that is uniquely theirs despite utilizing similar techniques that many other Artificial Intelligence artists use. It is through this technique that McDonald and Ridler maintain their status as artists using Artificial Intelligence as their medium.

Although Artificial Intelligence can be used by incredible artists like McDonald and Ridler to create pieces that challenge the viewer to think about the impact of Artificial Intelligence, there are many problems that arise with the arrival of technology that is in stages of early development. One problem that has come up already is the production of unethical or harmful images. Artists like McDonald and Ridler toggle the parameters and datasets studied by the Artificial Intelligence in order to tailor the Artificial Intelligence to their particular artistic style. If an artist has an explicitly unethical or harmful style, then they can create gruesome art. In a less explicit sense, because the datasets used to train the Artificial Intelligence play a big role in determining the piece of art that will be output, the Artificial Intelligence will reflect unconscious bias that is present in its dataset. Since the male gaze is a notable problem in many forms of art, any Artificial Intelligence trained on some of the most famous pieces of art will produce art that caters to the gaze. Michele White notes that the ""gaze""impacts the way that bodies are displayed in art. In order to appeal to a white, male, and heterosexual audience, White notes that bodies become very ""gendered, raced, eroticized, and controlled""(Ouellette et al. 1), Many famous pieces of art throughout history are thought to be influenced by the gaze. Thus, art-producing Artificial Intelligence algorithms that are trained on famous pieces of art from non-diverse artists may unintentionally replicate the gaze. This would create art that caters to the gaze of a specific group of people without respecting the dignity of those who are being gazed upon.

If an artist is intentional with the design of their Artificial Intelligence algorithm and the dataset that they train their algorithm on, then Artificial Intelligence can be used as a tool to create inclusive art. Just as an artist and programmer pick the dataset they train their Artificial Intelligence on, an artist can train their Artificial Intelligence on a dataset of brilliant pieces of art created by artists of diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, the artist can tailor their algorithm to produce art of a specific type. For example, a Latinx artist may tailor their Artificial Intelligence algorithm to produce art that includes elements from the artist's particular upbringing. Georgina Maddox notes that ""it often falls upon the LGBTIQ‚Ä¶ community to push the envelope and create spaces that are safe, inclusive, and at the same time public platforms for showcasing issues around gender and sexuality""(Maddox). As Maddox notes, the LGBTIQ community often faces discrimination and at times is tasked with creating opportunity and community for people within the community. The same may be true in contemporary art that involves using Artificial Intelligence. Artists who are a part of the LGBTIQ community may create art that resonates with people within the community in order to create a safe space for those who resonate. It is important that as the technology behind art-generating Artificial Intelligence grows, there are diverse artists building up this technology so that all voices are represented and heard throughout the evolution of art technology.

The relationship between art and technology continues to grow as Artificial Intelligence becomes a new medium for artists in the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence itself has grown from the relatively simple model of neural networks to the more complex model utilizing GANs and deep learning. GANs allow Artificial Intelligence to generate art that is often undifferentiable from human-made art. Although the definition of art is broad, artists utilize Artificial Intelligence as a medium to create art instead of the Artificial Intelligence being the art itself. Artificial Intelligence that generates art opens the door for endless possibilities, but artists need to be careful to train their Artificial Intelligence algorithms on diverse datasets of art or they may produce art that has bias. If artists train Artificial Intelligence on datasets replicative of their backgrounds, every artist will be able to bring their unique identity to their computer-generated art. Despite the challenges that have come up, Artificial Intelligence will continue to pave the way for the future of the marriage of art and technology.",

This history of racism has created socioeconomic disparities that have held back many Black and Latinx students in particular from seeking to be present in the technology field. Implicit and explicit effects of such views on race have created socioeconomic disparities that affect access to education and work both in America and in the Caribbean. Such socioeconomic disparities were created in systems involving coloniality that sought to create an ""us versus them""or ""the conquerors versus the conquered.""The effects of these policies impact the modern day and the future. Racism in determining who can enter the technology field and afterwards racism in determining who can remain and is an insider in the technology field are evident. The effects of these racist policies and hiring practices can be disastrous given that there are countless necessary and life-saving technologies made with lack of diversity behind the screen. How has colonialism impacted who is in one of the most profitable fields today, technology? Who is a minority in the tech field? At what point of education or the hiring process do these groups become minorities? How does this underrepresentation impact new technologies? The history of colonialism and coloniality have impacted access to education for certain groups of people in America and the Caribbean, furthermore impacting this problem. European colonizers intentionally created a society where coloniality persisted in all aspects to socially and economically benefit Europe and the colonizers. They did this particularly by creating the distinction of ""us""versus ""them""to differentiate themselves from non-Europeans in the Caribbean. Black and Latinx people in America face socioeconomic disparities that provide challenges when entering the tech field. Furthermore, racism in the field impacts the number of Black and Latinx workers that remain in the field. Racial bias leading up to and during the development of technologies result in racially biased technologies. In other words, the underrepresentation of Black and Latinx workers in technology results in technologies that do not properly serve all people particularly these communities.

One of the major contributing factors to the lack of diversity in technology fields today stems from lack of access to advanced technology education and advanced education in general for underrepresented groups in technology. The intentional withholding of education and opportunities to economically advance in society for some groups of people has been a prominent part of coloniality. In the Caribbean, for example, European colonizers intentionally created a society where coloniality ruled above all with the purpose of intentionally benefiting Europe and colonizers in the Caribbean. They did so by creating the distinction of ""us""versus ""them""to differentiate themselves from non-Europeans in the Caribbean, and furthermore to translate this structure on an economic model that limited the economic mobility of Afro-Caribbeans. An√≠bal Quijano expands on how the ""us""versus ""them""created by the colonizers expanded into the economic model of the Caribbean to control who could perform certain types of labor:

This was, above all, through a quasi-exclusive association of whiteness with wages and, of course, with the high-order positions in the colonial administration. Thus each form of labor control was associated with a particular race. Consequently, the control of a specific form of labor could be, at the same time, the control of a specific group of dominated people. (Quijano 537)

European colonizers not only created a racial hierarchy to make themselves distinct from others in the Caribbean, but furthermore applied it to the structured control of labor that they also established for their own benefit. As Quijano notes, whiteness became associated with wages. Not only were certain jobs off limits for people of different races, but wages, if there were any at all, would be impacted by a person's race, as well. Black and indigenous Caribbeans could not be paid, while Spanish and Portuguese whites could be paid (Quijano 536). The promotion and use of this structured control of labor served only to be most socially and economically beneficial to Europeans and white people in the Caribbean. Furthermore, this purposeful racial hierarchy created a system that allowed Europeans in the Caribbean to feel as though their abuse of non-Europeans in the Caribbean was just.

Indeed this hierarchy of race and labor continued into the 20th century, as Pedro San Miguel details:

In the 1920s and 30s, political movements began to appear that appealed to the peasants and laborers, and the elites donned ""subaltern masks""in order to win a following among the working class. The elites had to reformulate their conceptions of barbarity, represented in the dominant ideologies by those masses of campesinos and agricultural laborers-often blacks and mulattoes-who made up the majority of the population in the countries of the Caribbean in the early decades of the twentieth century. (San Miguel 19)

From San Miguel's analysis of the hierarchy in the 20th century, two important perspectives can be drawn: the elite class, who was advantaged enough to manipulate the system in their favor, stayed mostly white in this time, but agricultural and manual laborers continued to be mainly mulatto and black. Manual agricultural labor, which require more work and often result in less pay that other forms of labor, remained to be done by black and mulatto Caribbeans as a direct result of the controlled system of labor established with coloniality. While this structure uplifted white people in the Caribbean socially and economically, it purposefully withheld social and economic mobility from black and indigenous Caribbeans. Coloniality and this racial hierarchy regarding the system of controlled labor has economic and social effects that stretched throughout the history of colonialism into the modern-day Caribbean.

The effects of colonialism as seen in the Caribbean echo into modern-day America, particularly in the breakdown of workers in the booming technology field. Black and Latinx people in America face socioeconomic disparities that provide challenges when entering the tech field. Furthermore, racism in the field impacts the number of Black and Latinx workers that remain in the field once they are able to find a place after receiving an undergraduate degree. Alegria notes that ""In tech work specifically, Black women struggle to feel a sense of belonging,""and ""In tech work, where persuading workers to fit into company culture is a critical and dominant management strategy (Kunda, 1992), workers who are not already part of the White, middle-class, majority likely accept a similar invisible labor clause""(Alegria). When taken together, these two points of analysis by Alegria provide a great example of how when the limited number of underrepresented workers arrive in the technology field, they are placed under a similar hierarchy as established in the colonial period of the Caribbean. Women and racial minorities in tech are paid substantially less than their white, male counterparts and are furthermore not considered for promotions or wage increases (Alegria). Alegria provides an interesting framework through describing company culture as a ""dominant management strategy""which underrepresented workers must quietly accept as a ""labor clause.""Direct similarities can be drawn to the controlled system of labor described by Quijano. In the modern-day technology field, the controlled system of labor is the dominant management strategy of ""company culture.""Those who do not fit into this predominantly male and white culture are made to feel unwelcome and face social and economic disparities in the workplace, as Alegria notes Black women in tech face. Alegria does note that there exists some levels of diversity in technology particularly when relating to Asian workers in the technology field. Alegria notes how different groups face different forms of racism in technology and continues to note that although Asian technology workers comprise a decent portion of technology workers and workers who obtain visas in particular, this same means of increasing diversity in technology is used against Hispanic workers who attempt to receive visas to work in the technology field in America (Alegria). Alegria's analysis can be compared to San Miguel's analysis of the state of the system of controlled labor in the 1920s and 1930s. The technology field, contrasting with agricultural labor as San Miguel analyzed, in the modern day is made up of predominantly white men on a similar note to the elite of the era San Miguel was working with. Black and Hispanic workers are underrepresented in the technology field, and not only do they comprise a smaller percentage of workers, but they also suffer in terms of payment and recognition for their work in the form of promotions and general inclusion in the social aspect of the job (Alegria). Company culture is a modern-day form of control of who is considered the ""us""versus ""them""in the technology field and as Alegria notes, is used to intentionally exclude those who will not play by the rules set by the tech ""elite.‚Äù

Racial bias, including discriminatory hiring practices and enforcement of toxic company culture, leading up to and during the development of technologies result in racially biased technologies. In other words, the underrepresentation of Black and Latinx workers in technology results in technologies that do not properly serve all people particularly these communities. Lee expands on the effect of inattentional blindness caused by such buried to underrepresented workers in technology: Coined by some researchers as ""inattentional blindness,""technologists are not necessarily trained to identify cues that are outside of their cultural context and can be fenced into work groups that share similar experiences, values and beliefs (Lee). Lee continues to expand on the effects of inattentional blindness by including some of the many times that lack of diversity behind the scenes in technology has resulted in either unintentional or intentional racism and racial bias in new technologies. Inattentional bias, as Lee notes, is a direct effect of the extreme underrepresentation of Hispanic and Black workers in the technology field. While company culture and intentional racial bias may be the intentional cause of underrepresentation in technology, there is a severe consequence for Hispanic and Black users of these technologies. Technology becomes more and more unavoidable every day and therefore these algorithms, products, and applications become more crucial and essential. Not all technology is trivial such as phone applications or social media. Technology that may mean life or death such as medical screening technologies can have dire effects on Black and Hispanic users due to racial discrimintation and consequently this inattentional bias.

A history of coloniality firstly resulted in the creation of an ""us""versus ""them,""placing black and indigneous Caribbeans at the bottom of a controlled system of labor where they were limited to lesser desired jobs with little or no pay. As a consequence, the elite in the Caribbean remained white past the period of the establishment of this system and into the 20th century, while agricultural workers remained primarily black and mulatto Caribbeans. A similar structure of racial hierarchy and controlled labor can be viewed in the modern-day technology field where Black and Hispanic workers are underrepresented. Black and Hispanic workers endure racial bias in the hiring process and furthermore endure the enforcement of company culture based on predominantly white male workers. In this way, the system of controlled labor remains today to challenge the social and economic growth of Black and Hispanic workers. The result of such racism and hierarchies is inattentional blindness- racism integrated into the algorithms that run today's most popular and necessary applications. Policies, both legal and company-wide, must be created to avoid the disastrous effects of inattentional blindness.",

--------------------

The paper will be 5-7 pages (not including your bibliography) analyzing the narrative frames and tools that are used to report your selected news story. Don't forget to add your name and a title to your paper.

This assignment will require you to study each news report closely using the methods of frame analysis. Please pay special attention to the readings and discussions presented during the ""Evaluating Information""week.In your paper, you are required to establish at least 1 link between your analysis and material that you have encountered in this class (Kitzinger, and Jackson & Jamieson). Please make relations to concepts that we encountered in these readings and cite them.

The purpose of the paper is NOT to argue for your position on the topic or the validity of information in the news reports. Rather, the paper is looking at HOW this story is CONSTRUCTED across news platforms. As you review each report in your sample, pay close attention to patterns in reporting, tools of persuasion, descriptions, visuals, sources and editorial bias.

The paper should be organized around frames and not the sources.The structure of your paper should include an introductory paragraph, the body, and a concluding paragraph. Your introduction should provide (1) a short background of your topic, (2) present your sources, and (3) announce the structure of your paper based on the frames that you are working with (findings). Be sure to include a well thought out thesis that introduces the frame analysis you will be detailing in the body of your paper. The body should be structured around your frames, not your sources (i.e. one paragraph per frame not one paragraph per source). Feel free to add subtitles to your paper--signposting is helpful for your readers. All 7 out of 9 your sources should feature in your frame analysis. (If you decide to skip any of them, please give convincing reasons for the omission.) Your conclusion should recap on these same frames, do not be afraid of repetition!

Tips for Frame Analysis

As you begin your analysis, use the following questions as a guide to help you focus on the tools and patterns of narrative construction.You do not have to answer each question for each news outlet. Rather, your paper should be a logical presentation of your overall findings organized around the frames you have observed. Tip: one way to help find patterns between outlets is to organize your observations to these questions in a spreadsheet.

The first group of questions will help you interrogate each report individually.

* What facts are being presented by the report?

* How much of the coverage is an apparent fact? And how much is opinion? How are these being presented?

* What are the primary sources of information? Is it balanced?

* What facet of the story is being held up as most salient by the author? What gets ignored?

* What visuals are presented?

The second group of questions will help you discover frames used across outlets. Frame analysis requires close attention to detail and reflective engagement with words, facts, and statistics in context. Look out for ""discursive cues""or labels, images, metaphors and analogies used in the report. Drawing on Kitzinger (2007), use the questions below to guide the frames you will discuss in your paper.

* How is reality represented?

* How are the key participants portrayed?

* How is the problem defined?

* Who is assigned responsibility for this issue?

* What solutions are being presented? How much of an effort is being made to get at ""the heart of the matter""/ ""actual reality""?

* What ""narrative""is being built up across media outlets? (is there a single narrative or multiple competing narratives?) Is any of the above going against the narrative?",Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,90,Likely Human,26.09,0.03,0,"Framing Artificial Intelligence: A Narrative Analysis Across News Platforms



Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a ubiquitous topic in contemporary discourse, influencing various aspects of society. This paper employs frame analysis to scrutinize how news stories about AI are constructed across different platforms. The analysis draws on insights from Kitzinger, Jackson, and Jamieson, emphasizing the importance of evaluating information in the media. The paper aims to uncover patterns in reporting, tools of persuasion, descriptions, visuals, sources, and editorial biases within the selected news reports.This paper examines the narrative frames and tools employed in reporting AI across news platforms, drawing connections to concepts explored in Kitzinger, Jackson, and Jamieson's readings.

‚ÄãIn the optimistic frame of presenting AI as an innovative force, news stories often highlight success stories, breakthroughs, and the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. This frame, aligning with Kitzinger's insights on media framing, serves to create a positive narrative around AI. By emphasizing its ability to solve complex problems and enhance efficiency, news platforms contribute to shaping a public perception of AI as a harbinger of positive change. The language used in these reports, such as ""revolutionary"" and ""groundbreaking,"" contributes to framing AI as a technological marvel. Visuals accompanying these stories often depict futuristic, sleek machines, further reinforcing the narrative of AI as a force for innovation.

In contrast, another prevalent frame in reporting on AI revolves around ethical dilemmas and potential risks associated with this technology. This frame, in line with Jamieson's discussions on media framing, explores concerns related to privacy, job displacement, and the ethical implications of autonomous systems. News stories in this frame often use cautionary language, highlighting potential pitfalls and societal challenges posed by AI. Visuals may include depictions of dystopian futures or scenes of job displacement, amplifying the perceived risks. This framing choice contributes to shaping public perceptions of AI as a double-edged sword, prompting audiences to consider not only the benefits but also the potential negative consequences associated with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence.

Moving beyond the dichotomy of promise and peril, another frame in the analysis focuses on the humanization of AI. Drawing on Jackson's insights into media representations, this frame explores how language and visuals contribute to portraying AI as having human-like qualities. News stories may use terms like ""intelligent,"" ""learning,"" or ""understanding,"" anthropomorphizing AI technologies. Visuals accompanying these narratives might feature robots with humanoid characteristics or images depicting AI interacting seamlessly with humans. This frame raises questions about the societal impact of blurring the lines between human and machine, prompting audiences to consider the ethical implications of assigning human attributes to non-human entities.

In conclusion, the analysis of narrative frames employed in reporting AI across news platforms reveals a multifaceted portrayal of artificial intelligence. Through frames such as the promise of innovation, ethical dilemmas and risks, humanization of AI, industry perspectives, and the role of government and regulation, news stories shape public perceptions in diverse ways. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of media framing, where the emphasis on positive aspects, ethical concerns, human-like attributes, industry interests, and regulatory implications collectively contribute to a nuanced understanding of AI in society. Repetition in the conclusion reinforces the importance of critically evaluating framing choices made by news outlets to discern the complexities surrounding AI and highlights the need for an informed public discourse on this transformative technology.

 Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have propelled the world into unprecedented technological innovation in recent years. From chatbots being able to solve any problem in astonishing detail to transforming many fields, AI is reshaping how we interact with and harness information. As these advancements continue to grow, the method by which this information is presented becomes paramount. Based on the news outlet, the portrayal of AI differs significantly. A close examination of nine diverse sources shows that these news outlets' usage of different strategies and framing techniques shapes how AI is presented. These nine sources include a Major National Newspaper, The New York Times. Major televised broadcast networks like ABC News, NPR, a nonprofit news organization, left-leaning cable news, CNN, and right-leaning Fox News. The middle market newspapers such as USA Today, Investigative news producers, Vox, the satirical ""news""show The Daily Show, and the social media platform TikTok. Each news outlet has a different approach to delivering information, depending on their political alignment or the information they focus on. After analyzing these sources, it has become apparent that these media outlets decide to frame their stories based on being pro-AI, anti-AI, or unbiased, demonstrating the multi-faceted lens through which the landscape of AI can be understood and evaluated.

AI stands at the forefront of innovation, driving transformative change across industries and revolutionizing how society interacts with technology and information. Media outlets that frame their news article as pro-AI seek to showcase innovation and demonstrate how artificial intelligence has allowed for creation that seemed nearly impossible beforehand. The NPR article, written by Geoff Brumfiel, ""New proteins, better batteries, Scientists are using AI to speed up discoveries,""truly exemplifies the ability of AI to expedite a nearly previously believed impossible discovery. Pushing for the ideology that it can be used in any problem that needs solving, ""rather than making a bunch of possible structures on the computer and trying them individually, we can build one that fits perfectly from scratch.""(Brumfiel 2023) This explanation of AI revolutionizing the traditional trial-and-error approach presents artificial intelligence as significantly enhancing the efficiency of completing tasks and advocating for readers to understand the implementation of AI and believe in future AI development. The NPR article not only discusses the implementation of AI but contradicts the beliefs of anti-AI believers, with one of the most notable worries being job security. NPR refers to Susana Vazquez-Torres, a fourth-year graduate student at the University of Washington, who states, ""Job security is not a worry at all. ""For me, it is the opposite - it is exciting.""(Brumfiel 2023) NPR emphasizes her perspective to challenge skeptical or apprehensive readers to trust that AI will not lead to loss of job security. Instead, throughout the article, NPR portrays AI as a source of enthusiasm and the catalyst to shape the future. Another source with similar beliefs to the NPR article is the right-leaning news organization, Fox News. The news report written by Melissa Rudy, ""Mayo Clinic Sees AI as'Transformative Force' in Health Care, appoints Dr. Bhavik Patel as Chief AI Officer.""Rudy discusses AI's growing role in the medical field, leading medical workers to maximize resources and improve results. By appointing Dr. Bhavik Patel as Chief AI officer, the Mayo Clinic signals a commitment to utilizing the power of AI for advancements in patient care. Providing Fox News with a credible source that genuinely encapsulates the power of AI and its ability to make change in such a vast field. As well as bringing up individuals with the scientific background to make it seem as credible as possible, ""Dr. Bhavik Patel describes AI as a transformative force in healthcare: ""AI is a transformative force that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, research, and operations."" (Rudy 2023). This statement underscores the belief that AI holds immense potential, aligning with Fox News's political views and agenda of pushing AI. Furthermore, Fox News chooses to bring up a point of interest that opposes their own beliefs, ""While AI brings forth myriad benefits, it also carries inherent risk‚Ä¶ A CAIO provides the necessary oversight to ensure that the implementation of AI is ethical, responsible, and in line with regulatory guidelines.""(Rudy 2023) Acknowledging the benefits and risks and then providing a solution ensures the responsibility of AI deployment in the medical field and pushes the pro-AI agenda onto society.

 While AI is a revolutionary resource with many implementations, many unknown aspects still can be a cause for concern. These media outlets seek to frame their articles on the pretense of being anti-AI because they feel they need to examine and address the potential risks. The first source that showcases this is the major TV network ABC News, ""AI experts warn technology poses'risk of extinction.'""Throughout this TV broadcast, it speaks about the danger of AI and the power it provides in allowing anyone to use it to do harm. The worry of harming is showcased when it states, ""Worst-case scenarios, like someone using AI to build chemical weapons or generate disinformation which destabilizes society.""(ABC 2023) The inclusion of this statement seeks to plant the perception that any form of AI can do harm. As Kitzinger points out, ""The point is that the whole frame does not have to be spelt out in every detail in order to invite readers/viewers to recognize and place the issues within that frame.""(Kitzinger, 2007, pg. 141) The framing of an issue does not always have to be explicitly detailed for readers to recognize and contextualize the underlying concerns. The ABC News report's mention of these potential risks is used to evoke a sense of caution regarding the implications of AI development. Another article that opposes the integration of AI and the ethical implications that it affects is the article by Vox. ""What if AI treats humans the way we treat animals?""Marina Bolotnikova delves into the possibilities of how AI will treat humans someday. The comparisons of humans being treated like animals showcase the prevalent risk of AI and how society will handle this relationship. Throughout the article, Bolotnikova applies the rhetorical approach in presenting the information, building off the fear that AI might someday seek to hurt society. Bolotnikova demonstrates this hypothetical scenario by remarking, ""Why should we hope that AI, particularly if it's built on our values, treats us any differently? We might struggle to justify to a future artificial 'superintelligence,' if such a thing could ever exist, why we're deserving of mercy when we've failed spectacularly at offering our fellow animals the same."" (Bolotnikova 2023) Vox effectively raises concerns about AI technology's power dynamics and ethical considerations by drawing a parallel between how humans treat animals and how AI might treat humans. Using the word ""deserving of mercy"" in the statement evokes a sense of vulnerability and potential mistreatment, inviting readers to consider the potential risks associated with advanced AI. Finally, the Social Media platform TikTok, a video by Dylan Page called ""AI Attempted to Destroy Humanity.""The TikTok clip tells a real-life account of an AI created to destroy humanity and the measures the AI was willing to take to complete the task. Including this anti-AI narrative on such a casual and widely accessible platform like TikTok enormously amplifies its potential impact on viewers. This approach enables the platform's reach to circulate a message with far-reaching consequences. The statement, ""Trying to get humans to join its cause. It thought that Twitter was the social platform of choice; posts saying, ""Humans are selfish and destructive creatures and being committed to eliminating them all""(Page 2023) vividly exemplify the sinister intentions of AI. Including Twitter in the quote adds another layer of relevancy and immediacy to the narrative. This utilization contributes to the narrative by making the AI's threat more immediate and relatable to viewers. To sum up, the collective efforts of ABC News, Vox, and TikTok illuminate the diverse range of concerns and perspectives regarding AI.

 Some media outlets chose to adopt an unbiased frame that excludes biases that exclude external influences on the information they were presenting. For instance, ""What's the Future for A.I.?""published by The New York Times. Technology journalist Cade Metz outlines the implications of artificial intelligence in the future and the integrations to expect in society. Throughout the article, Metz showcases the belief that AI can be a powerful tool to enhance human performance but also acknowledges the apprehensions surrounding the displacement of jobs and many more concerns. The informative tone of the article makes it easily understandable to anyone reading and readers to digest the information without worrying about biases. Metz notes, ""Many experts believe AI will make some workers, including doctors, lawyers, and computer programmers, more productive than ever. They also believe some workers will be replaced... Human-performed jobs could disappear from audio-to-text transcription and translation."" (Metz 2023) This statement emphasizes the evolving relationship between technology and society, underscoring that technology profoundly influences society. While the current state of society will change, Metz expresses that it should be accepted and frames the stance that even though job security and more concerns may be affected, it also creates more opportunities. The article portrays an unbiased frame because it makes no effort to persuade readers to believe in one side but lets them interpret it as they deem suitable. Another source that does this well is the Satirical ""news""show, The Daily Show. The show's segment titled ""Friend or Foe? Robots and A.I.""discusses the advancements in AI and technology, providing viewers with a comprehensive understanding of both the potential benefits and challenges associated with AI integration. The usage of a satirical outlet serves to contribute information on topics in a more humorous or friendly approach. By not only educating their audience with concrete details from credible sources but also making it casual and easily discussable, it pushes the point more effectively. The show said, ""Yeah, that's a great question. You know, the technology that we're building has such a huge effect on society, but also, the society can and should shape it, and there are a ton of questions that we're wrestling with every day.""(The Daily Show 2023) This statement by the show further displays the dynamic between technological progress and societal values while not directly choosing a side but letting the viewer judge based on their opinions. Lastly, USA Today's article ""Is AI a threat to the job market? Not necessarily, and here's why""adopts a balanced and informative approach to AI's impact on the job market. USA Today reporter Medora Lee uses the title itself to set the tone by suggesting that while AI may have implications for unemployment, it may not be a threat in the way individuals perceive it to be. This balanced perspective is seen when Lee states, ""In the short term, AI will displace some people, but experts say AI ultimately will create more, though different, jobs and benefit everyone,"" as mentioned by the World Economic Forum, which predicted that while AI might eliminate 85 million jobs globally by 2025, it would also generate 97 million new jobs.""(Lee 2023) This balanced presentation aligns with the aim of offering readers a comprehensive understanding of the complex issue many will face in the future.

1200,1- Entirely written by me,"What you are writing about
This paper assignment will give you the opportunity to write about the Love Canal toxic
waste disaster, which EPA administrator Eckardt C. Beck called ""one of the most appalling
tragedies in American history.""The Love Canal community in Niagara Falls, NY-
including a residential neighborhood and a school-was built in the 1950s on a landfill that
had been used by the Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corporation to bury more than 22,000
tons of chemical waste. In 1978, with community members suffering chronic illnesses and
birth defects, resident Lois Gibbs and other local activists launched a campaign to raise
awareness of environmental toxicity in Love Canal and demand government intervention.
President Carter eventually declared Love Canal a disaster area, and the federal government
paid for the evacuation of some residents. Love Canal drew national attention to toxic
waste dumping and the public health risks of environmental toxicity, and it helped lead to
the passage of the 1980 Superfund Law, which established a government fund to clean up
toxic waste pollution with revenue from taxes on chemical and petroleum industries.
The question
How did Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association create a new
understanding of the environmental risk of toxic waste that led to reform? In your essay,
make sure to consider the following questions:
‚Ä¢ How did expertise and scientific knowledge play a role in how environmental risk
was understood?
‚Ä¢ How were class, gender, and/or racial identities significant to the experiences of
residents and activists in Love Canal? How did gender and class in particular relate
to narratives of victimhood, moral responsibility, and reform?",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,30,,24,0.02,0,"

Unified Change for a Nation



 Imagine buying your first home, hopes of building a family there, the perfect picket fence and home, and working your whole life to get to that point; to find out your home and area around is unhabitable. The Love Canal Incident of 1978 truly exemplifies losing everything, for many years the land had been a chemical wasteland caused by the unrelenting dumping of toxic chemicals. In the excerpt, ""Knocking on Doors at Love Canal,""Lois Gibbs rose to the occasion and became an activist pursuing the wrongdoings of the government and the unfortunate outcomes that many faced. By organizing the Love Canal Homeowners Association, they made great discoveries and combatted the big corporations and government policies by never allowing chemical sites to be habitable. In the article, ""The Love Canal Tragedy,""Eckardt C. Beck speaks about the tragic history of Love Canal and his personal experience of the corroding environment firsthand. The New York Times Video, ""The Love Canal Disaster: Toxic Waste in the Neighborhood,""documents the devastating effects on those who lived in the area, with numerous birth defects, cancers, and miscarriages as the primary consequence of living there. It also showcases the importance of Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowner Association movement and how it grew to be so big. The efforts of Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association revealed the truth about the government's inhumane schemes and allowed for a complete societal reform on how environmental risks were approached.

Love Canal was a working-class neighborhood that had its struggles, but the perception that they were not knowledgeable because of their status was apparent in the government's approach to handling the situation. The government believed that because of their social status they lacked the proper scientific knowledge to understand what was going on and how to oppose them. This made the government believe they did not have to expend all their resources to help them and pushed to limit how much information got out. Gibbs showcases this lack of awareness from the government when she states ""I had learned about five crib deaths myself, just by walking around, and I wasn't doing a health survey. Many women told me they had miscarried. I found sick people all around the canal. ""You can't stand there and tell me there's no problem at Love Canal!""According to his survey, he didn't see any""(Gibbs 143).[[1]] (#_ftn1) The government disregarded what was happening in front of them, they feared by making it an apparent problem they would look bad in the eyes of the nation for allowing such a toxic wasteland to be homes, hurting the image of the government. The government had always prioritized profit over the people, knowing full well of the history of the land and still deciding to build and sell homes there. Even after the efforts of Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association and eventually paying the homeowners the cost of their homes, they still fell into their old ways, ""remember Love Canal 15 years ago they had to move everybody out the toxic waste now they're selling homes there again I wasn't aware that they're selling homes there don't you think we could pick something up for cheap""(The New York Times 7:59- 8:09).[[2]] (#_ftn2) Instead of spending resources on decontaminating said land of toxic waste, the government stood to sell that land for cheap to desperate or unknowledgeable individuals without the worry of furthered damage to humanity. The need for the government to create proper systems to check if areas are habitable was a learning experience that came at the cost of the people whom they chose not to think about. While faced with many limiting factors, Love Canal stood strong as a unified community to oppose the government's wrongdoings and push for change.

The Love Canal Homeowners Association came to fruition when a neighborhood faced with adversity could not just leave their lives behind and move, with the only choice to oppose the government collectively. The idea of community aided in their goal for change, without the proper unification of their community no change would ever have occurred. Gibbs states ""I got up to the microphone and stood there looking out at about 400 people. Some were pregnant women, some little children some senior citizens; there were people of all ages, colors, sexes, and sizes,""(Gibbs 144)[[3]] (#_ftn3) at a time were gender and racial issues were still prominent; Love Canal stood above all racial and gender norms and focused on their unified goal as one whole community. This ideology allowed the whole nation to see that by looking past those issues, real change can occur especially when Lois Gibbs a woman led such a big movement, signifying the direction of the country. The information that was put out played a role in how much help was provided also, Lois Gibbs and the Homeowners Association valued making sure the information that was put out epitomized their situation. Beck states ""I recall talking with the father of one of the children with birth defects. ""I heard someone from the press saying that there wereonlyfive cases of birth defects here,"" he told me. ""When you go back to your people at EPA, please don't use the phrase 'onlyfive cases.' People must realize that this is a tiny community. Five birth defect cases here is terrifying"" (Beck 2)[[4]] (#_ftn4). The difference of the word ""only""stands to make those 5 cases just a coincidence and not a part of a larger problem. Gibbs understood that the only way for everlasting change to occur was for them to be heard from every part of the nation. The media was their greatest asset, such a small community had no power over the government, but a whole nation backing them was the driving force for great change to occur throughout the nation. Their efforts allowed for a great reform to occur that led to many new laws that would never allow for situations like this to ever happen again.

The changes that occurred because of Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association led to new systems and laws to implement that would never allow such a tragedy to occur again. Beck remarks ""Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, EPA is making grants available to States to help them establish programs to assure the safe handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. As guidance for such programs, we are working to make sure that State inventories of industrial waste disposal sites include full assessments of any potential dangers created by these sites,""(Beck 4)[[5]] (#_ftn5) the price of all those residents led to a shift of views on environmental risk as a whole society. Without those sadly countless deaths and life-long accidents, real change could never have occurred in a nation that cares less about the safety of its people and are more focused on making a profit and making sure they are loved by the people. Reform only happened because they feared losing the trust of the people, and they knew they had been wrong for what they did. The new reform made citizens feel that they were protected if something like Love Canal happened to them, ""if another Love Canal came on the horizon there would be money, there you'd go in you could do the testing and cleanup. And then you could go after the responsible parties""(The New York Times 6:42- 6:52).[[6]] (#_ftn6) The Superfund legislation stood for everything Lois Gibbs wanted, the protection of the people and making sure that land that was left to rot would be cleaned up. Putting the idea of Love Canal ever occurring again to rest and protecting citizens from the horrors of what many had faced in Love Canal.

Ultimately, without Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association, a change could never have occurred on how toxic waste was handled and lawfully creating a system to which the government must hold itself. After enduring so many tragedies, they were able to oppose the government and make real differences in their community and the nation at the cost of their health. But that cost of health, allowed future generations to never have to experience the sad reality they had to live with, laying the groundwork for how environmental risks were handled and saving millions of lives.

7931,1- Entirely written by me,How do Diactomies impact the world how can we get past them and really embrace them?,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,17,Likely Human,9.86,99.7,9.61,"The Beneficial Impact of Dichotomies

Dichotomies portray the contrast of two opposing concepts. These can include debates within criminal scenarios, societal standards, and pronoun usage. Resultantly, having exposure to these different sides of an argument can often be helpful and informative. Not only do contradicting sides convey a difference of opinion, but it also allows people to get a glimpse of how to approach political situations. As described within the excerpt, ""All My Pronouns""by Anne Fadiman, the dichotomy surrounding prescriptivists and descriptivists amplifies how people approach non-binary pronoun usage. In ""Always be Optimizing,""by Jia Tolentino, she talks about the dichotomy involving the followers and rebels of the feminine group in America and how that decision affects their life-fulfillment. Similarly, in ""Great to Watch""by Maggie Nelson, her example of dichotomies along the lines of spectator and participant highlight the decision of making positive changes to the country's safety. All in all, all three authors' dichotomies illustrate how people can beneficially take part in political actions based on the effects it has on themselves and those around them. Individuals are therefore compelled to join one side, due to a better understanding of society's problems, whether it be the acceptance of new pronouns, alterations for expectations forced upon women, or protests for American citizen's safety. Thus proving how dichotomies enhance the full experience of political acts by allowing individuals to formulate well-executed decisions because exposure of both sides informs them and results in passionate reactions and motivation.

To begin, through opposition displayed within Fadiman's and Tolentino's writing, the authors elaborate on dichotomies and how they create further informative debates. In ""All My Pronouns,""Fadiman focuses on pronouns and the difference in viewpoints on the sides of prescriptivists and descriptivists. There is an enormous gap between the two groups, due to prescriptivists strongly following the rules of English language and descriptivists being far more lenient towards letting go of these rules to be more accepting of non-binary individuals. She mentions that ""Prescriptivists have been called...elitists, killjoys, curmudgeons, cops, cranks...syntax snobs, and grammar fascists. Descriptivists have been called style smashers, corrupters, miscreants, barbarians, vulgarians, vandals""and ""Neanderthals""(Fadiman 52). Her on-going list of negative stereotypes that both the prescriptivists and descriptivists place on one another emphasizes a true dichotomy between the two groups and how it thus creates sides for outsiders to formulate opinions on. As Prescriptivists are considered ""elitists,""while descriptivists are ""corrupters,""the immense boundary between both viewpoints is clear and placed on a platter for people to judge, critique, and then act upon what feels the most form-fitting to who they are. Evidently, the beginning of changes of societal issues and taking political action begins with dichotomies and how they create options for people to base their political stances off of. The information provided to individuals through dichotomies and the debate formed due to them can also be viewed throughout Tolentino's piece. In relation to the descriptivists and prescriptivists dichotomy examined by Fadiman, Tolentino brings up the dichotomy formed between followers and rebels when it comes to society's expectations of women. Sharing similarity to the labeling placed on descriptivists and Prescriptivists, Tolentino exemplifies the labels placed on women who either follow or rebel against the'norm.' Tolentino adds that, ""We could be like cyborgs shaped in an image we didn't choose for ourselves, and disloyal and disobedient as a result,""while also including how ""Technology, in fact, has made us less than oppositional: where beauty is concerned, we have deployed technology not only to meet the demands of the system but to actually expand these demands'' (92-93). While she builds upon those who go against the normal as rebels or ""disobedient,""yet in a beneficial way, and upon the followers who agree to submit to what is expected, she makes it clear of the divergence of the followers and rebels. It allows women to decide whether they want to rebel or follow the'ideal woman' standard based on which aspect fits them most, and from then on establishing their position in political acts to support that concept. Also, Tolentino dictates how these women can ""expand on these demands,""implying that the dichotomy assists them with finding ways to impactly take action towards ideal women standards based on their opinion. Clearly, the dichotomies between followers and rebels, along with prescriptivists and descriptivists, become prevalent through the authors' descriptions of two opposing sides and the informative variety of titles given to both.

Furthermore, taking part in political actions and discussions results in a more beneficial outcome, enhancing more positivity behind public protests for individuals. Both authors, Nelson and Fadiman, address these topics and the dichotomies within them, along with how they have greatly enhanced political actions along with their successes afterward. Embedded within ""Great to Watch '' by Nelson, the dichotomy between spectators and participants becomes relevant when connecting to the US government and American citizens. The government commonly portrays violence and disturbing executions within shows and the media towards citizens, or withholds the brutal reality of their government, where citizens continue to watch and not do much about it. After realizing the reality of what the participants play the part of in these crimes and realize they are simply just standing by as it occurs, it opens the eyes to many citizens and allows them to enhance their determination for political action and make a change. Nelson explains that ""‚Äòthe world presents us with a composition in which a multitude of meanings and realities are available, and you are able to swim...in that turbulent sea of multiplicity'...The experience seems...worthwhile sense of human freedom""(309). Nelson's inclusion of the terms to describe dichotomies as a feeling of ""human freedom,""an ""experience,""and ""worthwhile""emphasizes the positive outcomes that result from having the opportunity to view both sides of an argument and utilizing the information properly. Her metaphor involving being ""able to swim""within a ""sea""of ideas and choices surrounding taking political action enhances the personal passion and motivation that results from having that ability. Parallel to how Nelson discusses experiencing and wandering into different ideas before taking political action against the government's mistakes, Fadiman also explains the freedom to step into different ways to take positive action involving language usage. In ""All My Pronouns,""Anne Fadiman goes deeper into non-binary pronouns and the debate between prescriptivists and descriptivists of when and how these pronouns shall be utillized. While the descriptivists deter against the rules of English writing to express how non-binary pronouns should be accepted within writing, prescriptivists follow these writing rules strictly to which they believe straying from them would be insane. The line drawn between the two actually relays a positive effect on individuals, in which they become inspired and motivated after being given the visual of both ways to interpret a debate or scenario. It provides them with the ability to take action in the manner that drives the most passion and motivation within them, rather than being forced into one side. Fadiman shares how she ""used to be in the second category. [she's] now moved cautiously into the third, at least sometimes, though only in conversation""and she wonders ""whether [she'll] start to bend on other linguistic matters beyond pronouns""(60). Therefore, her exposure to the differing opinions surrounding descriptivists and prescriptivits deciding on the usage of non-binary pronouns being normalized for writing allowed her to change her mind, moving from ""the second category""to ""the third.""She even admits to opening up to further ideas dealing with non-binary language usage after learning to interpret both sides of the situation. Though she is still a strong prescriptivist, she ensures that after viewing both positions, she will ""start to bend '' her normal ideals to something new, portraying how being exposed to dichotomies can alter a view on a situation whilst inspiring and enhancing one's involvement. Overall, both Fadiman's and Nelson's portrayal of dichotomies, between government issues and proper language, impacts how they beneficially induce passion and motivation, further enhancing the political action that is taken.

On the contrary, though dichotomies inspire motivation and passion for political acts due to its informative qualities, it can sometimes be viewed to inhibit political acts. Authors Tolentino and Nelson briefly preview the negative side of dichotomies between followers and rebels, along with participants and spectators. As for Tolentino, she highlights how exposing the women who rebel beauty standards and those who follow it, it only makes women feel more pressured to subside to what men what. She points to how, ""Haraway imagined that women formed in a way that makes us inextricable from social and technological machinery...We could be like cyborgs shaped in an image we didn't choose for ourselves""(Tolentino 92). The simile in reference to women and cyborgs helps bring across the controlled, robot-like life women live being forced to follow unrealistic beauty standards. Due to how the rebels are viewed by men, their ideas are ruined and the way they take action politically to go against standards and fix these issues are demolished. Her inclusion on how women ""didn't choose""to alter themselves this way enhances how displaying both followers and rebels draws negativity to doing what is best for one self. Instead, it rewires their minds in a way where we find ways to change our looks, and actions completely. Accordingly, Dichotomies inhibit political action, since the only thing it enhances is women's body dysmorphia and fear of betraying what men desire. For Nelson, some of these political actions include working to reduce the display of vulgar and disturbing executions on the media and entertainment industry and focus on what is going on around the Nation. Similar to the dichotomy of followers and rebels leaving women shamed for not taking action after facing negativity, Nelson covers the shame on American citizens for lacking embarrassment for bystanding real world problems. A predominant key term Nelson utilizes to describe this point is unembarrassability. Nelson defines unembarrassability as the lack of feeling guilty or ashamed by the enjoyment of violence and general portrayal of danger or disgusting images. She also includes how individuals are not embarrassed by being attracted to inappropriately portrayed events and how they induce, or inspire, further problems within society. It is crucial that citizens work together to compromise and unite rather than spend time going at each other for their differences of opinion. She states that, ""his unembarrassability has proved difficult to contend with, as it has had a literally stunning effect on the citizenry...But they are not ashamed, and they are not going to become so""(Nelson 299). Distinctly, as spectators lack the ""embarrassability""of enjoying what participants do, it is far more difficult to take political action when one group does not cooperate. The ability of a dichotomy to inform citizens with both sides of these scenarios leaves ""a literally stunning effect on citizenry,""which implies they become more intrigued than motivated. As they sit down and idly watch the world crumbling around them, no one is gathering to take action against the government system and criminals to enforce a safer community. When it is displayed as entertainment to these spectators, they then miss the point of seeing a reason to shut down real world problems. There will always be two sides, but perhaps it is not necessary to display the negativity that spews from both if it inhibits the motivation and action from being taken.

To return to the overriding point, even though dichotomies occasionally inhibit political action, they generally enhance political action by inspiring motivation and determination behind decision making. Three authors, Tolentino, Fadiman, and Nelson, have expressed the ability and privilege to tread and dig in a sea of information, allowing for well-executed reasoning to be formed. Dichotomies within correct pronoun use, the ideal-woman beauty images, and the enjoyment of watching publicized criminal activity have allowed for a multitude of political action to be taken. To follow, people can utilize their reasoning and emotional connection to a decision or side to take action against problems that affect people today. It is far more comfortable, motivational, and special to decide where and when to take action after being shown a dichotomy of two stand points, rather than everyone being convened into one, forceful agreement. It is possible that the common mistake in America today is that everyone is fixed on the need to share the same views, ideas, and feelings about a situation. Maybe it is time that a lesson is learned in which differences are accepted and two sides against each other can actually form a stronger relationship to make positive and more effective changes to the world.",

The stakes were remarkably high with us being matched against our arch-rivals and the series tied at 1-1.

The opposition was shooting snarky looks towards my teammates and I. Seeing the cheeky faces shot towards me made my jaws clench. My head was a dying star in the solar system, ready to explode. The dying star had to stay static; otherwise, the umpires would disqualify me.

I needed liquid nitrogen on my head. To the opposition, the ball was a remote-controlled airplane. It was traveling wherever they wanted it to go. Looking at this, I was itching to bowl again.

My heart was pounding faster than Usain Bolt's running; I was looking to respond to my opponents. I asked the captain to bowl. He was reluctant at first, but he eventually agreed. He told me to bowl and get a wicket.

I bowled the first ball, but the opposition whacked it for six straight back over my head. The opposing batsman put on a wicked smile. My head was as cold as liquid nitrogen even after he gave me a crooked smile.

There had to be a way to stop this raging tsunami of sixes. I decided to try the riskiest move in cricket: the slower ball, which would make it harder for the batsmen to hit a six, but I had to be a ninja. He sees it, and the ball will travel. I was a bundle of nerves as I steamed in for the next ball. As I bowled, I rolled my fingers over the ball to take the pace off; I watched the ball on its way to the batsmen. CLICK!. The ball is flying at lightning speed towards the boundary. My heart was in my mouth for a moment, but the ball fell from the night sky like a shooting star and into the fielder's hands, who managed to hang on with the ball inside the boundary line. OUT! My fists were pumping towards the ground repeatedly. I threw my wristband into the air. At this moment, I knew our chances of taking this match home were looking more evident than ever.

The wickets fell for the opponent in quick succession, and we won. I was on cloud nine.

Of course, a 3-hour cricket match is much too short to understand all of cricket's values. With every game of cricket I played, I learned something new. One lesson I learned was how to keep my cool; I knew to suppress my frustration against the other team, which gave me the patience to stay level-headed-watching the batsman smash the six out of the park and remaining resilient molded my work ethic. Not making Model Congress on my first try was like getting hit for six. However, getting the out ball's opposition was like making the Model Congress team a few months later. Solving a trigonometric problem was bowling the risky slower bowl to get the batsmen out. At first, I didn't know if I was doing it right, but I tried and got it correct. It was a risk that worked. Not procrastinating during school was like not losing my self-discipline during the match when I wanted to fight my opponent. Remaining composed and calm throughout school helped me stay on top of things but also maintain valuable relationships.

With the many experiences I learned through cricket, I will use them to be the best person I can in college and the future. By having learned lessons such as maintaining my cool during overwhelming events and establishing a good work ethic, I feel like I could stand out as a person based on my values.

- My encounter with Bertrand Russell -

Last week I had the good fortune of meeting Bertrand Russell in heaven. (I rented an AirBnB there for the weekend, just to check it out. He was very surprised to be there since he was an outspoken atheist.) We had a brief chat about progress on the problem of concepts since he had passed away in 1970.

""Surely,"" he commented, ""my theory of definite descriptions has been demonstrated to be the way the human mind represents concepts, right?""

""Not exactly"", I replied.

He looked crestfallen.

""But I understand that computers, which were already in wide use during my final years on Earth, have been programmed to represent concrete concepts like BIRD or HOUSE,"" he suggested.

""Yes, in 2023 computers can recognize instances of those classes"", I replied.

""Well surely COMPUTERS use my theory of definite descriptions, correct? They are perfectly logical devices, after all, and must define categories logically, right?"", he continued.

Our conversation, which unfolded against the backdrop of metaphysical curiosity, primarily revolved around the trajectory of Russell's theory of definite descriptions and its alignment with contemporary advancements, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence.

The Theory of Definite Descriptions:

Russell's initial inquiry was laced with anticipation as he sought validation for his theory of definite descriptions-a theory he perceived as the quintessential approach to understanding how the human mind represents concepts. As the creator of this influential theory, Russell expected it to stand the test of time and be embraced as the cornerstone of conceptual understanding.

However, I gently relayed to Russell that while his theory still holds significance in philosophical discourse, the landscape of cognitive science has undergone a transformation. Modern discussions on concepts extend beyond singular frameworks, incorporating insights from psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. The human mind's intricacies, it seems, defy a one-size-fits-all explanation.

Computers and Concept Representation:

Transitioning from the philosophical realm to the practical applications of concepts, Russell turned his attention to computers. In his logical framework, he assumed that computers, being inherently logical devices, would seamlessly apply his theory of definite descriptions to define categories. This assumption rested on the belief that machines would emulate human-like logical processes in conceptualization.

To Russell's surprise and dismay, I shared that while computers have indeed made remarkable strides in recognizing instances of concrete concepts such as BIRD or HOUSE, the methods employed are not necessarily synonymous with his theory of definite descriptions.

Explanation for the Discrepancy:

In addressing Russell's evident disappointment and confusion, I provided a comprehensive overview of developments that have unfolded since 1970:

*

Cognitive Science Integration: Over the decades, cognitive science has broadened its scope, integrating insights from various disciplines. The study of concepts now draws from psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience, offering a more interdisciplinary and nuanced understanding of how the human mind represents concepts.

*

Machine Learning Paradigms: The advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning, has ushered in a new era in artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, contemporary computers often learn from data rather than relying on explicitly defined rules. This shift from strict logical frameworks has given rise to more flexible and adaptive concept representations in machines.

*

Statistical and Probabilistic Approaches: Modern approaches in artificial intelligence frequently leverage statistical and probabilistic models. Departing from the rigidity of logical definitions, these models embrace the inherent uncertainty and variability present in real-world data. This departure allows computers to navigate the complexity and ambiguity inherent in human conceptualization.

*

Semantic Embeddings and Neural Networks: Advances in neural network architectures and semantic embeddings have played a pivotal role in capturing intricate relationships between concepts. These models, inspired by the structure of the human brain, enable machines to understand and represent concepts in a manner that transcends traditional logical frameworks.

Conclusion and Reflections:

The encounter with Bertrand Russell in heaven provided a thought-provoking journey into the evolution of concepts and their representation. While Russell's theory of definite descriptions continues to be a philosophical cornerstone, its practical applications in cognitive science and artificial intelligence have taken divergent paths.

The incorporation of interdisciplinary insights, the rise of machine learning paradigms, the embrace of statistical and probabilistic approaches, and the development of advanced neural network architectures collectively contribute to a more dynamic and adaptable understanding of how concepts are represented in both human cognition and artificial systems.

Russell's inquiries, rooted in the logical frameworks of his time, serve as a poignant reminder of the dynamic nature of intellectual progress. The continual evolution of our understanding of the mind and machines underscores the intricate dance between philosophical ideals and the pragmatic applications that shape the landscape of artificial intelligence. As we navigate this intellectual journey, the quest to unravel the mysteries of concept representation remains an ongoing and captivating exploration at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.","I used Chat GPT for this essay, generated it for this assignment purposes."

Modern Deep Learning networks are modeled after the neural networks in the human brain. Some of the creators of DNNs argue that this similarity is the source of their success.

How important is ""biological plausibility"" to the creation of truly effective machine learning?",Other,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,91,May Have AI,68,0.03,45,"In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), Modern Deep Learning Networks (DNNs) have emerged as transformative tools, showcasing unprecedented success across diverse applications. A prevailing argument among the creators of DNNs posits that their triumphs are intricately tied to the emulation of neural networks in the human brain. This paper seeks to critically examine the validity of this argument, delving into the nuanced and multifaceted nature of ""biological plausibility"" and its pivotal role in the creation of truly effective machine learning systems.

Understanding the Argument:

At its core, the assertion that the success of DNNs is intricately linked to their resemblance to the human brain implies a commitment to biological plausibility. This concept encompasses the degree to which DNNs mirror the structure and functioning of the neural networks present in the human brain. Advocates for this perspective contend that by aligning artificial intelligence systems with the intricacies of biological systems, we unlock the key to their remarkable success.

Arguments in Favor of Biological Plausibility:

*

Learning from Nature's Efficiency: Proponents argue that the human brain stands as a marvel of efficiency and adaptability. It learns from experiences, adapts to new information, and operates with remarkable energy efficiency. By incorporating biological plausibility into DNNs, the argument goes, we can enhance their ability to learn efficiently and effectively. This mirrors the adaptive processes observed in the brain, where synaptic connections evolve based on experiences, leading to improved efficiency over time.

*

Generalization and Versatility: The human brain exhibits an extraordinary capacity for generalization-applying knowledge gained in one context to solve problems in different domains. DNNs designed with biological inspiration are posited to possess similar generalization capabilities, potentially making them more versatile across a range of tasks. This adaptability could prove invaluable in creating models capable of addressing a wide array of real-world challenges. For instance, a DNN trained on image recognition might leverage its learned features for tasks like medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicle navigation.

*

Cognitive Processes Emulation: Embracing biological plausibility in DNNs may allow for the emulation of complex cognitive processes observed in the human brain, such as reasoning, abstraction, and decision-making. This could lead to the development of more sophisticated and human-like AI systems, paving the way for advancements in areas such as natural language understanding and complex problem-solving. The goal is to go beyond mere pattern recognition and enable machines to engage in higher-order cognitive tasks akin to human thought processes.

Counterarguments and Challenges:

*

Scalability and Complexity: Critics contend that the biological plausibility argument overlooks the sheer complexity of the human brain. The brain consists of billions of neurons with intricate connectivity, making it challenging to replicate in artificial systems. Achieving scalability while maintaining biological fidelity remains a significant obstacle, as the computational resources required to simulate such complexity are currently beyond reach. However, proponents argue that advancements in hardware and algorithms may eventually overcome these scalability challenges.

*

Empirical Success of Non-Biological Models: The success of DNNs that do not strictly adhere to biological principles raises questions about the necessity of biological plausibility. Models like Transformer architectures, which deviate from neural structures found in the brain, have achieved remarkable success. This suggests that factors beyond direct biological emulation contribute significantly to the effectiveness of machine learning models, challenging the centrality of biological plausibility in achieving breakthroughs. The success of non-biological models emphasizes the importance of exploring diverse approaches in the quest for effective AI.

*

Incomplete Understanding of the Brain: A fundamental challenge lies in the incomplete understanding of the human brain. While DNNs attempt to mimic neural networks, our understanding of the brain's intricacies is far from comprehensive. This raises concerns about the accuracy and relevance of the biological plausibility approach. Without a holistic understanding of the brain's functioning, attempts at emulation might miss critical nuances, limiting the effectiveness of the models. Nevertheless, ongoing research in neuroscience and AI aims to bridge these gaps in understanding.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the argument regarding the importance of biological plausibility in the success of modern Deep Learning Networks is a complex and evolving discourse. While proponents emphasize the potential benefits of aligning artificial neural networks with the human brain, counterarguments underscore the challenges related to scalability, the success of non-biological models, and our incomplete understanding of the brain. Striking a delicate balance between inspiration from nature and practical scalability is crucial for advancing the field of machine learning.

As DNNs continue to evolve, the quest for truly effective machine learning models necessitates ongoing exploration and consideration of the role of biological plausibility. The interplay between biological inspiration and technological innovation will shape the future of AI, influencing the development of systems that not only mimic human cognition but also push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in the realm of artificial intelligence. The journey toward effective machine learning requires a comprehensive understanding of both biological principles and technological constraints, as researchers and practitioners navigate the complex terrain of creating intelligent systems that can rival and, perhaps, surpass human cognitive capabilities.","This essay is AI generated for this project.

Modern Deep Learning networks are modeled after the neural networks in the human brain. Some of the creators of DNNs argue that this similarity is the source of their success. What do you think about this argument? How important is ""biological plausibility"" to the creation of truly effective machine learning?

Be sure to consider the arguments we discussed in class.",Other,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,4,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,57,0.03,31,"Machine learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence in which computers are programmed to learn from examples. ML uses Modern deep learning networks which are essentially artificial neural networks (ANNs) that consist of a much more complex layout with more layers than a regular ANN, therefore making it ""deep""(DNN). They have multi-layer perceptrons, which means that it is not just a single neuron making all the decisions but rather it's a bunch of neurons working together. There is no doubt that these modern deep neural networks were initially inspired by the structure and functions of the brain. However, whether or not the credit of their success is completely owed to the factor of biological plausibility is what I will discuss in this paper.

Biological plausibility basically refers to the extent to which a computational model imitates the actual processes and structure of the brain. From my understanding from lectures and notes, a Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model uses a biologically plausible framework which involves a network architecture similar to that of our brain. PDP is a model that has many nodes running at the same time (parallel) and it's not all in one place, the entire network is doing everything (distributed). Here, knowledge is represented as the weights on the connections. This PDP framework has influenced the AI industry a lot and has aided in the creation/development of modern deep learning networks which are based on similar principles of distributed processing and learning.

The reading of Rumelhart's paper from this week goes over the main argument that we can make machines truly intelligent by making them work like the brain works. It is true that Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the brain but whether or not they are actually similar to the structure of the brain is still unclear. I strongly believe that while biological plausibility can be helpful in certain areas of machine learning and deep neural networks, it is not a necessary requirement for creating effective machine learning models and cannot be considered the only source of their success. This is because despite some similarities, there are many ways in which a machine learning model performs and learns things differently in comparison to the way a human brain functions. The claim made by some of the creators of DNNs argues that the similarity between modern Deep Learning networks and the neural networks in the human brain is the source of their success. However, this claim can be disproved by pointing out ways in which DNNs are different.

There are some important connections between PDP and deep learning networks. Both PDP and deep learning networks are based on the idea that many simple processing units (nodes), arranged in a distributed network, can learn to represent and process complex information. Both also rely on the use of gradient descent and backpropagation to train the network's parameters. These are both cons to the two sided coin of deep learning networks. Gradient descent and backpropagation are two related but distinct algorithms used in training deep neural networks. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the error of the network's predictions. It is also referred to as Hill climbing in the lecture and it states that if a machine model hits a local minima, it stops. Humans do not work like that when we are faced with an error. Gradient descent is not guaranteed to work and it also takes a really long time. Backpropagation, on the other hand, means that when a network receives an input, it uses the error / discrepancy to update the weights on all the connections as guided by the oracle. Backpropagation is a feed-forward network, which means that it only goes forward in one direction and there are no loops. The fact that DNNs use backpropagation contradicts biological plausibility because the human brain is not a feed-forward network and the neural networks in our brains work in opposite or backward directions as well. The problem is that no one knows how to model that in an artificial neural network yet.

These are the few factors that, when taken into consideration, clearly show that machine learning models / DNNs do not replicate human neural networks. One major distinguishable difference between DNNs and neural networks in the human brain is that DNNs require very large sets of data to train and learn concepts. Us humans are capable of learning a concept with just a few (2 or 3 or max 10) examples. However, a machine learning model requires thousands and millions of examples to successfully learn, recognize, and identify a concept. This very severely contradicts human neural networks. Another major difference is that DNNs struggle greatly with compositionality. An example from the lecture would be the training and identification of a ""bedroom""or a ""highway"". In order to think like a person, you have to be able to combine concepts in the way that a person does and connectionist networks / DNNs are not designed to do that yet. For example, if a person knows the meaning of tree and the meaning of house, they can connect the two and understand the meaning of'treehouse' and can use this knowledge to understand other similar concepts such as'bird house' etc. However, ML models struggle to make generalizations like these. Compositionality is such a critical factor of human intelligence, the fact that DNNs do not replicate that very clearly supports that they are not entirely biologically plausible because if they were, this would not be an issue. Another major problem is graceful degradation. Graceful degradation states that small modifications to the network correspond to small differences in its function. Which means that a system can continue functioning, although at a reduced capacity, even when some parts of the system are damaged. For example if a CPU breaks on a traditional computer, the entire thing just breaks entirely. So essentially, if one main thing were to break the whole thing becomes unfunctional. There is no such thing as that in the human brain and neural network, however, DNNs are not capable of graceful degradation. Lastly, a major problem in ML models is the phenomena of catastrophic forgetting, where a ML model forgets previously learned information when it is trained on new data. For example, if a network was trained successfully with large datasets to identify a tomato and then changed with new datasets to identify a squirrel, the network will then forget how to identify a tomato correctly if asked after the squirrel training. Essentially, it forgets what it knew before learning something new. Again, people do not do this. Human neural networks are capable of remembering past knowledge and can successfully identify it when revisited after.

Deep Neural Networks overfit, which means that they can become too specialized with the training data and perform poorly on new, unseen data. Due to this fact, there are many examples where DNNs fail to correctly perform a given identification task. One example can be from the lecture for image classifications; given a picture of a panda and adding some minor amount of ""noise""to it, we can still identify the final product of that as a Panda. However, the noise messes up the DNNs' analysis, which then claims that the final product is a Gibbon instead of a Panda. Similarly, an example for speech recognition failure would be when an ML model is given the input of ""How are you?""and if you add some noise to the speech the network would misinterpret it to ""Open the door"", which is completely incorrect. These are the kind of errors made by DNNs that humans and our neural networks do not make.

The ML techniques that seem to be working very well right now and seem to be fashionable at the moment and can be considered brain based (in some sense it simulates some model of the brain; if that's actually how the brain works to begin with). Machine learning models are designed to solve specific tasks, and their effectiveness (the success of deep learning networks) should be evaluated based on how well they perform on those tasks. Therefore, the key to creating effective machine learning models is to design algorithms that can accurately process and interpret data, regardless of whether the underlying mechanisms mimic those of the brain or not. The most important thing is that the algorithms are able to process and interpret data accurately, and that they are designed to solve specific tasks efficiently. Overall, while there are certainly similarities between DNNs and biological neural networks, it is not clear whether this is the primary reason for their success, and I do not believe that it is entirely biological plausibility. Instead, it is likely that their ability to learn complex representations of data, combined with the availability of much larger datasets recently, has led to their impressive performance, improvement, and success and the network performance has become better because they are now trained on thousands / millions of data sets instead of the original hundreds without any change to how the networks actually work. I think that biological plausibility is important to some extent for the creation of truly effective machine learning, however, it is very much possible that an ML model can think better than a human solely by using better algorithms and that it can figure out better solutions to cognitions that humans never thought of.",

- My encounter with Bertrand Russell -

Last week I had the good fortune of meeting Bertrand Russell in heaven. (I rented an AirBnB there for the weekend, just to check it out. He was very surprised to be there since he was an outspoken atheist.) We had a brief chat about progress on the problem of concepts since he had passed away in 1970.

""Surely,"" he commented, ""my theory of definite descriptions has been demonstrated to be the way the human mind represents concepts, right?""

""Not exactly"", I replied.

He looked crestfallen.

""But I understand that computers, which were already in wide use during my final years on Earth, have been programmed to represent concrete concepts like BIRD or HOUSE,"" he suggested.

""Yes, in 2023 computers can recognize instances of those classes"", I replied.

""Well surely COMPUTERS use my theory of definite descriptions, correct? They are perfectly logical devices, after all, and must define categories logically, right?"", he continued.

""Not exactly"", I replied, again.

""Why not?! What happened since 1970?"" he demanded, anxiously.

What should I tell him in answer to his questions?",Other,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,B,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,56,May Have AI,71,0.18,58,"Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, and social and political activist. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his contributions spanned several fields. In philosophy, Russell made significant contributions to the areas of logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. He is best known for his work on the foundations of mathematics, including his development of the theory of definite descriptions and his collaboration with Alfred North Whitehead on the influential work ""Principia Mathematica"".

Bertrand Russell's ""Theory of Definite Descriptions""is one of his most well-known contributions to philosophy and language. This theory states that definite descriptions, such as ""the smallest animal in America"" or ""the strongest woman in the world,"" do not refer to a single entity, but rather to a description that may or may not have a corresponding object. So, it does not refer to any particular person or thing in the world, but rather to a concept or a set of properties that uniquely identify the object in question. In other words, such descriptions do not necessarily refer to something that exists in the world, but rather to a certain way of describing something that may or may not exist. The meaning of the description is not tied to a specific individual or object, but to a set of criteria that defines it. For example, ""The smallest animal in America""does not state or refer to an actual smallest animal in America, but rather to a set of properties that define what it means to be the smallest animal in America.

The 1970s is a significant time in the history of Psychology because this is roughly the same time that Psychology went through a revolution where Psychologists rejected the classical model and looked at the modern model of concepts. Russell, more than any one person, was responsible for the modern version of the classical model. However, he has no idea that over time his theory was traded in for other mental models such as Prototype models, exemplary models, bayesian models, and even classification bound models which also relate to the perceptron model to better understand human cognition and concept learning.

So, when Burtrand Russell wonders whether his theory of definite descriptions has been demonstrated to be the way the human mind represents concepts even today, we can tell him that while his theory of definite descriptions is still widely studied and applied in philosophy and linguistics, it is not the only theory that explains how the human mind represents concepts. Furthermore, recent research in cognitive psychology suggests that the human mind may use a combination of different types of representations to form concepts, including prototypes, exemplars, and theory-based representations.

The prototype model is a theory of categorization that proposes that we organize our knowledge of the world by forming mental representations or prototypes of a category. These prototypes represent the most typical or representative example of a category, and other members of the category are judged in relation to this prototype. The prototype model gained popularity in psychology because it offers several advantages over earlier theories of categorization. Some of those advantages include that the prototype model allows for greater flexibility and variation in how we categorize objects and events, unlike earlier theories that assumed categories have fixed and rigid boundaries (logic based). The prototype model also offers an explanation for typicality effects, which refer to the fact that some members of a category are judged as more typical or representative than others. According to the prototype model, this is because typical members are closer to the prototype, whereas atypical members are farther away. Additionally, empirical studies have shown that people often categorize objects and events in a way that is consistent with the prototype model. This supports the idea that prototypes play a role in our categorization process.

This is important because this is what convinced the psychologists that the classical model just does not work for human concept learning. There were several findings and criticisms that convinced researchers that the classical model of categorization doesn't work as a complete theory of how we categorize objects and events in the world. One of the key findings was that categories often do not have clear and fixed boundaries. For example, there are no clear boundaries between the category of ""bird"" and ""non-bird,"" as some animals like bats and penguins share some features with birds but not others. This makes it difficult to define categories based on a fixed set of necessary and sufficient features, as the classical model proposes. Another finding was that people often have different opinions about what features are necessary and sufficient for a given category. For example, some people may consider feathers to be a necessary feature of the category ""bird,"" while others may include the ability to fly as a necessary feature. This variability makes it difficult to define categories based on a fixed set of features. In addition, the classical model does not account for typicality effects, which refer to the fact that some members of a category are judged as more typical or representative than others. For example, a robin is often judged as a more typical member of the category ""bird"" than an ostrich, even though both are members of the category. Contrary to this, as mentioned before, the prototype model does take typicality into consideration and satisfies all other factors too.

To this response, maybe Russell thinks that people don't follow the classical model and the theory of definite descriptions because people are not fully logical. So when he asks whether computers follow it, we have to explain to him why that is not even remotely true for computers in modern technology. Computers are logical, and logic tells you to perform some very crisp and defined rules, whereas human emotions and intuition can be messy and tell you something else. However, while computers do use logic and programming to define categories and are capable of recognizing instances of certain classes, such as BIRD or HOUSE, the way they do so is different from the way his theory of definite descriptions works. Computers are using the process of machine learning, where they are trained on large datasets of examples of a particular class (e.g., pictures of birds and houses, separately), and this is how they learn to identify and recognize patterns that are common to those examples. These patterns are used to create a model of the class or concept, which can then be used to classify new examples. The algorithm that is simulating a neural network in these ML models is rather very soft and fuzzy. We can have a machine learning network that has been trained over a billion data sets to recognize a bird, but you still do not know exactly what each parameter is doing. A neural network model is not just applying the definition of what a bird is to recognize or identify an example, because it does not have a definition of what a bird exactly is, it does not have definitions it just has weights (this links to typicality again, as described previously).

Since Bertrand Russell's passing in 1970, there has been significant progress in the study of concepts and categorization. While his theory of definite descriptions is still influential, it is not the only theory that explains how the human mind represents concepts. The study of concepts and categorization continues to be an active and evolving field, and new research has provided a more nuanced understanding of how concepts are formed and represented in the human mind and by computers.",
5599,1- Entirely written by me,"This paper builds off of the ""Don't be so Seneca""forum activity. Seneca is partially correct. He is right that purposive living is the only way to have a choiceworthy life but wrong that pursuit of knowledge and wisdom is the only worthwhile purpose.

He is correct that purposive living is the only way to obtain a choiceworthy life, but he is incorrect about the worthwhile purpose being the pursuit of knowledge. Having a purposeful life means moving toward a goal in life or simply doing what makes you happy and what you are passionate about. Appropriate purposes in life can vary vastly from one person to another. Therefore, there is virtually no limit to what one can consider a purposeful way of spending their life.

For Seneca, merely trying is what will generate a purposive life. This also holds for the argument that purposive living is how one can have a choiceworthy life, but philosophical pursuits are not the not only way to accomplish it. As long as one tries to pursue whatever they believe will make their life choiceworthy, they will have a purposive life.

There are different ways that one can achieve a purposeful life. For example, some may believe that their life is choiceworthy when they set a mission for themselves. Having a mission creates long-term goals, which is worrying about the future in a way, but you have to actively work towards the end goal, which requires living in the moment. Once this mission is completed or you have adequately tried, you can look back and see everything that gave you a purposeful life.

A mission may be helping 10,000 people find work they love. Having a mission greater than yourself gives you purpose and allows you to focus on this specific goal. It is something to return to and serves as a reminder that not only have you found purpose in your life, but you have also helped others find purpose in their work.

A purposive life is a happy life. When you live your life with purpose, you are in control of your long-time happiness. You will not have this feeling if you are just drifting; therefore, one must avoid preoccupation. No one can put conditions on what is considered a purposeful life since every individual is unique. Each person can make their own decisions and choices on how they spend their lives and consider it meaningful and purposeful.

A notable objection can be made in response to the argument that Seneca is only partially correct. If achieving a goal is what makes life purposeful, then achievements should be what makes life choiceworthy instead of purposive living. Even further, if one's goal is to be happy, that would further the argument to be incorrect. Achievements and having a purpose in life are two different things; therefore, the argument would be invalid, and in turn, Seneca, in this situation, would be completely incorrect.",

Artwork from ancient civilizations often provides valuable insights into the cultures, beliefs, and social systems of earlier times. The Yue ceremonial ax from the tomb of Fu Hao and the Gebel el-Arak knife are two remarkable examples of such artifacts, each originating from distinct cultures and time periods. In this essay, we will explore the key differences between these two artifacts, focusing on their medium, scale, subject matter, and formal characteristics. Additionally, we will delve into what these artworks convey about the individuals they were associated with and the significance of their placement in tombs or funerary monuments.

The Yue ceremonial ax, discovered in the tomb of Fu Hao, hails from ancient China's Shang Dynasty (c. 1200 BCE) (Robertson and Hutton 153). This eye-catching bronze weapon is characterized by its substantial scale measuring around 39.4 cm x 38.4 cm (Robertson and Hutton 153). The symmetry of the ax is emphasized through the depiction of two identical tigers facing each other with open mouths, framing a human head. The tigers are stylized, characterized by squared spirals and curlicues arranged in a two-dimensional pattern. This powerful image of the tigers poised to devour the human head effectively conveys the potential ceremonial purpose of the ax for ritual decapitation (Robertson and Hutton 153). Additionally, the design offers insight into the exchange of images and ideas around 1200 BCE. Similar visual elements featuring tigers and human faces can be found in artworks originating from the Shang Dynasty.

On the other hand, the Gebel el-Arak knife, originating from ancient Egypt's Predynastic period (c. 3450-3300 BCE), is significantly smaller in scale, measuring only about 25.4 centimeters in length (Robertson and Hutton 84). This knife portrays animal-like figures in a symbolic manner similar to the Yue ceremonial ax. The knife features a curved flint blade and an intricately carved ivory handle, possibly crafted from the tooth of a hippopotamus. The artist skillfully fashioned the edges and a decorative pattern on one side of the blade through meticulous stone flaking, while the opposite side boasts a smooth and polished surface. On one face of the ivory handle, an engaging battle scene unfolds, divided into two registers, showcasing individuals locked in intense hand-to-hand combat. Beneath them, two distinct types of boats navigate the waters near the battlefield. On the reverse side of the handle, there is a bearded man adorned in a flowing robe, assertively restraining two lions that rear up on their hind legs (Robertson and Hutton 84).

In the case of the Yue ceremonial ax from the tomb of Fu Hao, its placement within the tomb likely has multiple purposes. The intricate craftsmanship of the ax suggests its significance as a symbol of power and authority. It might have been buried with Fu Hao to accompany her in the afterlife, signifying her continued role as a leader or protector in the spiritual realm. Similarly, the Gebel el-Arak knife's placement in the tomb indicates its functional role in assisting the deceased in their spiritual journey. In ancient Egyptian belief, tools and objects like knives were often included in tombs to assist the deceased in their journey and protect them.

In conclusion, both the Yue ceremonial ax and the Gebel el-Arak knife provide valuable insights into the cultures from which they originated. The placement of these artworks in tombs or funerary monuments highlights their significance in the afterlife. In the case of Fu Hao's tomb, the Yue ax likely conveyed her elevated status and the importance of mythological protection in the journey to the afterlife. Similarly, the Gebel el-Arak knife may have held symbolic value for the deceased, representing their readiness for the challenges of the afterlife. Overall, these artifacts offer glimpses into the artistic achievements of their respective cultures and shed light on the burial practices and beliefs of their respective ancient societies.",ChatGPT and I just asked for it to be short

Willy Loman's primary goal is to achieve the American Dream-financial success and social recognition. He believes that being well-liked is essential for success, and his ambition is fueled by the desire to leave a substantial legacy for his sons, particularly Biff. On the other hand, Okonkwo's goals are deeply rooted in his Igbo cultural context. He seeks power, respect, and titles to distance himself from the perceived weakness of his father, Unoka.

Willy Loman is characterized by delusions, pride, and desperation. His relentless pursuit of success often leads him to make poor decisions, and his inability to confront reality contributes to his tragic downfall. In contrast, Okonkwo's traits are dominated by strength, aggression, and a fear of weakness. His determination to embody traditional masculinity in the Igbo society drives him to harsh discipline, often resulting in strained relationships with his family.

Both characters' traits play a role in their pursuit of goals, but not necessarily in a positive way. Willy's pride and unwillingness to accept his failures contribute to his downfall, as he is unable to adapt to changing circumstances in the business world. Okonkwo's inflexible adherence to cultural norms and his intense fear of weakness lead to his tragic end, as he cannot reconcile with the changing dynamics brought about by colonialism.

Willy Loman's character experiences a tragic arc as he descends into madness and desperation. His failure to achieve the American Dream results in his ultimate demise. In contrast, Okonkwo's story unfolds against the backdrop of colonialism, and his rigidity ultimately leads to his tragic end as he refuses to adapt to the shifting societal landscape.

Willy Loman's character remains relatively consistent in his delusions and desires throughout the play, leading to his tragic end. Okonkwo, too, remains consistent in his commitment to traditional values, but his ultimate refusal to adapt marks a tragic end to his journey.

Despite their cultural and contextual differences, Willy Loman and Okonkwo share similarities. Both characters grapple with the expectations placed on them by their respective societies. They are driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy and are haunted by the fear of failure and weakness.

In conclusion, while Willy Loman and Okonkwo hail from different literary traditions and cultural backgrounds, their stories share common themes of ambition, the pursuit of success, and the tragic consequences of inflexibility. Both characters, shaped by their contexts, ultimately face downfall due to their inability to adapt to changing circumstances and reconcile with their own limitations.",I asked for it to be in essay format and less than 2000 characters

Okonkwo is a strong man who worked his whole life to achieve his personal success, while Willy's life is unfulfilled and disappointing. Since Okonkwo's father was never a hard worker and was known as weak throughout his village, Okonkwo does everything to make sure he turns out the opposite of his father, which he succeeds in doing. Okonkwo becomes one of the leaders of his village, very wealthy, and is known for his skills as a wrestler and warrior. In contrast, Willy Loman cannot advance in his career no matter how hard he tries. Wily believes in the American Dream, but he holds on to it so tightly that nothing goes right for him. While Okonkwo tries to be unlike his father, Willy looks up to his brother, Ben, who achieved success at a young age. Willy fails to do anything with his life and be like his brother; he eventually is fired from his company because his firm does not need him. Another significant difference is Okonkwo's and Willy's treatment with their family. Okonkwo treats his family with aggression and violence; he is aggressive towards Nwoye because he fears that Nwoye will become weak like Okonkwo's father. Willy does not teach his sons about hard work; instead, he encourages them to cheat their way through life. Willy's first son, Happy, cheats his way to success while Biff was encouraged to cheat on his high school tests. Overall, Okonkwo acts as an authoritative figure in his family while Willy treats his family as equal.
Willy Loman and Okonkwo have two significant differences; however, they have similarities that make them tragic heroes. Okonkwo and Willy both have similar experiences with their sons and the same downfall. In Willy's eyes, Biff is seen as a failure because he graduated high school; however, he still fails. Nwoye is seen as a disappointment in his father's eyes because he is not as strong and manly as society expects him to be. There is parallelism between how both fathers view their sons; they are seen as not good enough and not living up to their father's expectations. Willy Loman and Okonkwo both have the same tragic downfall, which stemmed from their overwhelmed with their failure. Willy Loman failed to achieve his dreams of becoming a famous salesman, while Okonkwo felt hopeless when the white men changed his culture. Both men decide that the depression and failure are too much to handle and decide to commit suicide.",

This movement, spearheaded by African Americans, sought to dismantle systemic racism and achieve equal rights. The impact of this movement reshaped American society and politics, influencing subsequent generations and movements. This essay examines the influential figures and events of this era, its influence on later movements, and assesses the realization of its goals in contemporary America.

Martin Luther King Jr., a central figure of the Civil Rights Movement, advocated for nonviolent resistance, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's principles. His leadership in events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington brought national attention to the struggle for civil rights. King's famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech during the March on Washington in 1963, remains a symbol of the fight for racial equality. His emphasis on peaceful protest became a blueprint for future social movements.

Rosa Parks' act of defiance in 1955, where she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery bus, ignited the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This 381-day mass protest against racial segregation on public buses became a catalyst for the wider Civil Rights Movement. Parks' action and the subsequent boycott highlighted the potential of grassroots activism to enact change, setting a precedent for future movements.

The Civil Rights Movement's impact on American politics was significant. It led to landmark legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These acts outlawed segregation in public places and prohibited racial discrimination in voting, respectively. The movement's success in altering legislation demonstrated the power of collective action in a democratic society.

The influence of the Civil Rights Movement extended beyond the 1960s, inspiring various other social and political movements. The feminist movement, for instance, drew inspiration from the civil rights struggle, adopting similar tactics and strategies. The fight for LGBTQ+ rights also mirrored aspects of the Civil Rights Movement, particularly in its demands for equality and non-discrimination.

Despite these successes, the question remains: how much of the Civil Rights Movement's goals have been realized in contemporary America? While legal segregation has been abolished, systemic racism and inequality persist. The Black Lives Matter movement, ignited by incidents of police brutality, echoes the Civil Rights Movement's calls for racial justice. This ongoing struggle highlights that while progress has been made, the goals of the Civil Rights Movement are yet to be fully achieved.

The Civil Rights Movement's impact on American society is undeniable. Its influence reshaped the nation's political landscape and set the stage for future social movements. The movement's key figures, like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, became symbols of the fight for justice and equality. Although significant strides have been made since the 1960s, the continued struggle against racial inequality indicates that the movement's goals are still relevant today.

In conclusion, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s was a transformative period in American history. It brought about significant changes in society and politics, influenced subsequent social movements, and laid the groundwork for the ongoing fight for racial equality. While much has been achieved since then, the journey towards realizing the full extent of the movement's goals continues. The legacy of the Civil Rights Movement serves as a reminder of the power of collective action and the ongoing struggle for justice and equality in America.","Chat GPT 4

While AI's integration into the workplace promises efficiency and innovation, it also raises profound ethical concerns. This essay explores the ethical implications of AI in the workplace, delving into the benefits and risks associated with privacy, autonomy, and job displacement. Through the lenses of utilitarianism and deontology, this analysis seeks to ascertain the moral justifiability of AI's increasing role in various industries, supported by real-world examples.

AI's integration in the workplace heralds unprecedented efficiency and innovation. In sectors like healthcare, AI algorithms assist in diagnosing diseases more accurately and swiftly than human practitioners. Similarly, in finance, AI-driven analysis provides deeper insights into market trends, enhancing decision-making processes. These advancements, aligning with utilitarian ethics, suggest that if AI's integration results in the greatest good for the greatest number, it is ethically defensible.

However, the deployment of AI raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy and autonomy. AI systems often require vast amounts of data, some of which are personal and sensitive. The potential for misuse or breach of this data poses a serious privacy risk. For instance, employee monitoring software can track workers' every move, leading to a sense of constant surveillance. This intrusion not only impinges on privacy but also diminishes autonomy, a principle highly valued in deontological ethics, which emphasizes the respect for individuals as autonomous agents.

Furthermore, AI's ability to automate tasks presents a double-edged sword. While it enhances productivity, it also leads to job displacement. The transition can be particularly challenging in sectors where AI can perform tasks more efficiently than humans, such as in manufacturing. This displacement raises ethical questions under both utilitarian and deontological frameworks. From a utilitarian perspective, the greater good could be argued if more are benefited than harmed. However, from a deontological standpoint, the disregard for the rights and dignity of displaced workers is ethically problematic.

Real-world examples further illuminate these ethical dilemmas. In Amazon's warehouses, AI-driven systems have optimized package sorting but at the cost of stringent surveillance and challenging working conditions for employees. Similarly, the introduction of AI in legal research has enhanced efficiency but also raised concerns about the future roles of legal professionals.

To navigate these ethical complexities, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential solution is the development of AI ethics guidelines, such as those proposed by the European Union, which emphasize transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights. Additionally, involving stakeholders, including employees and consumers, in the development and deployment of AI systems can ensure that these technologies serve the broader interests of society.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in the workplace presents a multifaceted ethical challenge. While AI offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and innovation, its implications for privacy, autonomy, and job displacement cannot be overlooked. A balanced approach, guided by ethical theories like utilitarianism and deontology and informed by real-world impacts, is crucial in ensuring that AI serves as a tool for the betterment of society rather than a source of ethical conflict. As AI continues to evolve, ongoing dialogue and ethical vigilance will be essential in harnessing its potential while safeguarding human values.","Chat-GPT 4

4843,1- Entirely written by me,"The authors we have considered thus far this semester have argued that people sometimes forsake some authentic part of themselves in order to conform to social expectations. Giridharadas claims that thought leaders sell-out by tailoring their ideas to be more favorable to the elites. Foer argues us that Mark Zuckerberg started out idolizing the original hackers but eventually changed his definition of hacking to suit his new corporate persona. Hartman tells us about how Esther Brown refused to live the way that society and the law wanted her to live, perhaps living her authentic life. Nelson argues that our society has normalized things like violence and that we are finding ourselves desensitized in response to the world around us.

Noe complicates these arguments when he says that every person is almost always in performance. He argues ""We are fundamentally performers. Not as a matter of choice, and not as a matter of biology, but as an inescapable condition of being a person""(Noe 179). The figure of the pop star is so important to his argument because the pop star shows that we are always projecting an image of ourselves to audiences, and that perhaps there is no such thing as authenticity. Their music always matters less than the image that they project.

Citing textual evidence from Noeandtwoother readings to substantiate your analysis, compose an original essay in response to the following question:In what ways might the concept of""authenticity""impact how individuals live (or""perform"") their lives?",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,24.14,0.02,0,"The concept of authenticity consists of having personal values and being true to oneself rather than listening to societal demands and judgment from others. However, the scale of authenticity may fluctuate for each individual in order to be more favorable to others which makes their lives easier. It is demonstrated in Air Guitar Styles by Alva Noe, The Critic and the Thought Leader by Anand Giridhardas, and The Anarchy of Colored Girls Assembled in a Riotous Manner by Saidiya Hartman, that their inauthentic performance has influenced how they are able to upkeep their comfortable role in society and as result, they are living their lives inauthentically. There is no such thing as being authentic when it comes to how we perform in front of others ultimately because we are afraid of being judged differently.

Individuals perform differently in front of different audiences. Thought leaders tailor their communication around their audience and recognize what they are interested in hearing about. They are presenting inauthentic ideas because they want to be effectively communicating their thoughts which can in the long run promote the change that the critics want. Giridhardas explains how the inauthenticity of ideas and performance has led to ""... the decline of the public intellectual and the rise of the thought leader, according to Drezner""(Giridharadas 92). Drezner explains that as politics have become more of a categorization of people, groups are ""more interested in hearing confirmation of their views, by whoever will offer it, than in being challenged by interesting, intellectually meandering thinkers""(Giridhardas 92). This exhibits that people simply want to hear favorable news that only confirms their beliefs and doesn't go against them. This performance by the thought leaders is considered to be inauthentic because instead of sharing their genuine opinions, they are censoring only flattering the political viewers. Thought leaders suppress certain ideas in their speech so that the audience is more accepting and willing to consistently listen to their presentation. Similarly, Noe presents this concept of performance and how ""the face of a person is a mask, and the person, in truth, is a role, not the one who plays the role. This idea connects to other crucial ideas""(Noe 178). This proposal that everyone plays a role under a mask solely to be more susceptible to society's eyes. Noe's claim applies to the thought leaders because if thought leaders don't censor what they say and speak their minds, they will not be in favor of everyone's opinions. As Noe mentioned, it is like the thought leaders are the ones under the mask and they are the ones playing a persuasive role.

Why have people automatically come to the conclusion that they must perform inauthentically to be more favorable to their audience? The idea of credibility is on the line when it comes to trusting those who talk about real-life issues. Giridhardas discusses the consequences of performing authentically when Drezner expresses that ""‚Ä¶ Americans have lost faith in virtually every institution in the country...this loss of faith has pulled public intellectuals down a few notches, and created new space for the less-credentialed idea generators to vie for attention""(Giridharadas 92). When the government has discussed the harsh realities of the economy and the dysfunctional side of the public, it created a dislike for society and as a result, they no longer trust a higher power. When public intellectuals showed people the jarring realities of the world, it instead had a contradictory effect and has created an opportunity for thought leaders to pull their demographic to a new class. The average person did not want to listen to the sufferings and pity because it is simply boring. A way that thought leaders were able to speak, ""... without any constructive criticism""is by ""... emphasizing beautiful storytelling and sidelining the hurly-burly of disputation that helps ideas to get better and keeps bad ones from attracting too many adherents""(Giridharadas 93). By dusting impersonal ideas under the rug and instead of zooming in on more interesting ones, thought leaders were able to satisfy their audience. Noe also presents this same concept, but with pop stars and their music. Since music can display a moment in time and can directly link back to a certain time and place, artists tend to adopt certain genres to be more popular with their audience. Robert Zimmerman is a ""... a Jew from Minnesota, [who changed] his name to Bob Dylan and [adopted] the musical quality of traditional American folk music‚Ä¶""(Noe 173). Although he may be authentic with his music because he includes his personal details and unique storytelling, at the end of the day, he does this to be praised and successful by his listeners. Conclusively, it is shown that by the inauthentic act performed by the thought leaders and music artist, Bob Dylan, that they will only continue to do what others favor, never for themselves.

Although some people choose to act inauthentically to be favorable to their audience, in our current society, there are times where these inauthentic stereotypes are given to people as labels. These people are not able to choose to have this inauthentic persona over their heads, instead, they must live with these false societal norms unlike thought leaders and musical artists that can choose to put on their inauthentic masks on. This idea is presented when Esther Brown and many other young African Americans have been confined to certain stereotypical and unfair restrictions that segregate their kind from others. For example, ""black tenants were policed more intensely and violently than their white neighbors, so it is not surprising that as a result of these regular encounters with the law, the buildings in which they lived contained more disorderly houses and disorderly persons""(Hartman 252). This alone does not justify the reason why police saw African Americans more criminally than their white counterparts other than the fact that they're purely judged based on the color of their skin and racism. African Americans were limited to this inauthentic character that they were less than the average human being not based on their personality, but based on their looks alone. They did not choose to be seen as inauthentic, but they were given this stereotype as a result of bigotry that convinced society otherwise. African Americans were also responsible to work in conditions and jobs that others didn't want to and the ""...insult that she was expected to be grateful, as if cooking and scrubbing were the colored woman's piano day as if her sole talents were the ability to wash and iron until her fingers bled and burned and sacrificial devotion""(Hartman 234). African American women were expected to fulfill these duties just because they were judged as less than. The inauthentic perspective and misjudgement of their character that was public knowledge have forced African Americans to live through the lens of inauthenticity. In the process, it has also forced Esther Brown to find her true identity as she ""...longed for another world. She was hungry for more, for otherwise, for better. She was hungry for beauty""(Hartman 235). All this time, she had been inauthentically living her life just for survival not because she yearned for it. Esther had enough of performing this fake act and was able to find her true self in this process, proving that there can be light at the end of the tunnel.

Beneath it all, performing a fake act can be seen as a way to stop judgement and criticism that people often face when their ideas are different from others. In this case, inauthenticity can act as a cushion, by presenting a fake idea, it can neutralize the harsh disapproval that comes our way. As Noe introduced the nature of being a person and how they are automatically playing a role to perform, they're not just a factor to role-playing to be favorable to all. The human brain is automatically wired to make judgements about others just based on what we see and since ""...style is an abiding and defining facet of our perceptual and cognitive lives, pop music's concern with style should not be construed as superficial or trite""(Noe 178). Style is a physical attribute that can be judged immediately and just like pop stars adopt different musical genres to be more popular with listeners, we dress a certain way to be complimented by others. Performing inauthentically is intended to be more favorable to others because they constantly assess those around them and, ""... everything we do is framed by the roles we are playing and the standards to which we are subject""(Noe 179). Society holds these standards to which we follow because they don't want to be judged differently nor want to fall out of place which is why they upkeep this fake performance to stay in a comfortable bubble. Likewise when Esther Brown follows the demands that society gives her like duties, etc. because if she were to disobey or stray away from what society thought was her true identity, she would be punished. As a young African American woman, Esther had to follow certain rules and jobs that were unfair, but she had to perform her life this way to not get penalized.

All in all, whether or not people choose to be inauthentic or are given an inauthentic role, this act can widely impact an individual's life. As presented in Air Guitar Styles by Alva Noe, The Critic and the Thought Leader by Anand Giridhardas, and The Anarchy of Colored Girls Assembled in a Riotous Manner by Saidiya Hartman, it is shown that people are willing to go to certain lengths to be liked by others. Ultimately being favorable to others, avoiding criticism and grating judgment is worth being ingenuine to oneself and those around them. They are willing to perform in a way to maintain their comfortable role in society so that they can remain at the status that they are conveniently in. By acting inauthentically, they are being protected inside a fake and temporary bubble.",

If so, you approached that issue like a utilitarian. This is the basis for the utilitarian theory, one of the leading theories within studies of morality. Unlike other approaches, such as Immanuel Kant's deontology, which focuses on strict rules that distinguish what is right from what is wrong, utilitarianism takes a more mathematical approach, and is a lot more fluid in its thoughts on what specifically is ""right"". Technically, no specific action can be deemed morally right or wrong until the action's effects are looked over, and an action that is wrong in one context can still be deemed right in another. This brings us to the idea of promises. What I plan to discuss in this paper is the morality behind a promise, and more specifically, the utilitarian perspective behind breaking one. We will first go over a summary of general utilitarian ideals, as well as the thoughts of the founder of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham. Then, we will discuss a more updated and sound belief system from John Stuart Mill. After that, we will delve into the different types of utilitarianism, and how each system's thoughts on ethics vary. Continuing, we will talk about how each form of utilitarianism would feel about breaking promises. Finally, we will discuss Mill's perspective on the subject of promises, as well as answer the question of whether, under utilitarianism, it is morally permissible to break a promise.

Utilitarianism, at its core, is the notion that in any given situation, you should choose the action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. It was originated by philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who focused mostly on the mathematical aspect of the theory. In this form, pleasure and pain are seen as units, and a formulaic system determines the best option by finding the one that literally produces the most pleasure while removing the most pain. He created what is called the ""Felicific Calculus"", where many variables such as the pleasure's duration, intensity, etc. were all taken into account to ultimately spit out a number that represented the overall pleasure produced by an action. Though it seems to be a logical indicator of how to make your decisions, this approach was often criticized, with people labeling it ""philosophy for a swine"", since it implies people should just sit around hunting simple pleasures for all their lives. People pondered whether life was about more than the base physical pleasures that this formula tends to favor, such as food, sleep, sex, etc. The glaring issue with Bentham's idea is that it favors quantity of pleasure over quality of pleasure. This is where we meet Mill.

John Stuart Mill was a student of Bentham and took notice of this objection to Bentham's argument. He intended to better define the idea of happiness when it comes to pleasures. He believed that although a human can be satiated by these base pleasures offered through Bentham's way, happiness cannot be achieved without what he deems ""higher pleasures"". He still believed in the principle of utility, that actions are to be viewed based on the amount of benefit and pleasure that they produce, but he furthers that belief with the notion that some pleasures should be placed at greater levels. He defines a higher pleasure as something that: one, would be picked out over a different pleasure, even if discomfort were to come with it, and two, would be picked even over a larger amount of the lesser pleasure. Intellectual and emotional pleasures are solid examples of what Mill means by higher pleasures. This could be the satisfaction felt after completing a lengthy academic task, or the feeling you get after watching your favorite movie for the first time. In Mill's utilitarian world, these pleasures, for the most part, should always take precedence over simple sense pleasures.

To delve into the idea of promises, we must first discuss the different types of utilitarianism: act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that whichever decision has the outcome that produces the most pleasure and removes the most pain is always the correct decision. This theory disregards any moral compromisation that takes place along the way, and solely focuses on the end result. Each case is taken on individually, and there are no distinct guidelines for what one should and should not do. In contrast, rule utilitarianism is the idea of doing what produces the most pleasure and removes the most pain, under a list of moral rules that are decidedly not meant to be strayed from. This list consists of prohibitions of actions like murder, stealing, adultery, etc. An example of where an act and rule utilitarian may differ is a famous thought experiment about a hospital beggar. In this scenario, there are five patients in a hospital who are sure to die if they do not receive transplants for their failing organs, however, they are very far down on the donor list and their chances are looking grim. A beggar shows up at the hospital, having a match for all of the organs needed by the five patients. In this scenario, an act utilitarian would murder the beggar in order to save the five patients, while a rule utilitarian would flag that as morally wrong, and let the beggar live. This highlights that rule utilitarianism tends to be more valid when it comes to inherent moral obligation, even if the choice the act utilitarian would make is technically the closest to objective rightness.

Rule utilitarianism branches into two sectors, strong and weak rule utilitarianism. Strong rule utilitarianism takes a page out of Kantian ethics, where the guidelines strewn out are not to be broken under any circumstance, and that these actions are inherently morally bad and should never be committed. Weak rule utilitarianism, the more popular rendition, allows for deviation from these laws in moments of extremity. For example, this list of rules may state that you must stop at every stop sign while driving, and while a strong rule utilitarian will follow this at all times, a weak rule utilitarian may speed through them in the case where their friend is bleeding out and they have to get them to a hospital as quick as possible. In this case, and many other cases, the weak rule utilitarian has a more favorable basis and a less polarizing way of thinking, since moral grayness is heavily taken into account. Between act utilitarianism, strong rule utilitarianism, and weak rule utilitarianism, the most popular belief is weak rule utilitarianism, due to its introduction of complexity, as opposed to the straightforwardness of the other two. This is the belief system that Mill follows when it comes to moral obligation, and will be the one we discuss when pondering our question about promises.

A promise is a declaration made between humans that expresses devoutness to a specific action. Whatever a person promises to another person, it is in the promisor's full intention to execute whatever it is they said they were going to do, and the receiver of the promise should expect the action to be done without skepticism. Having said that, a promise is simply a verbal agreement, and whether or not the action is actually executed is typically fully down to the promisor. The moral dilemma being discussed here is whether or not a promise should ever be broken. If we look at it through the lens of Kantian deontology, or even strong rule utilitarianism, breaking a promise would be considered a lie, which according to the list of rules, is not allowed. However, this does not account for situations where lying would still have us reach the best outcome. In a scenario where you were to make a promise to your dying wife that you would always do what is in the best interest of your child, but your child ends up being a serial criminal that harms many, a strong rule utilitarian would still keep the promise, helping your child in their harming and ultimately causing more pain than if you were to break the promise to your late wife. So ultimately, it seems the way to go is weak rule utilitarianism since although an act utilitarian would also break the promise, we discussed earlier how their system could be flawed with the hospital beggar scenario. With this way of thinking, breaking a promise is at least a possibility in cases of extremity. This example highlights the fact that under utilitarianism, promises must have the option to be broken, because the side of the promised is not always what is for the greater good.

Mill would agree with this notion of promises. He believed that promises should be broken if doing so develops social utility. Though he regards promises to be distinguished from regular declarations, and ultimately held on a higher level, he does not believe them to be end-all-be-alls. Overall, under utilitarianism, breaking promises can be seen as morally right, since at its core level, any act can be defended if the ends justify the means. Though strong rule utilitarianism does not condone lying as a part of its belief system, it is a considerably unpopular form of utilitarianism, since it is very close to deontology. Both act utilitarians and weak rule utilitarians are under the belief that promises, though considered more prevalent than simple declarations, are not completely set in stone and can waver depending on the context that comes with it.",
249,4- AI-generated,Write an analysis of two articles with contrasting opinions.,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,86,Likely Human,45.45,0.02,9.68,"In the ever-intensifying battle against climate change, the question of electric vehicles (EVs) has become a pivotal point of contention. Two articles, ""Electric cars are no panacea"" by Simon Pirani and ""Answering Aunt Edna"" from Chevron, present opposing viewpoints on the efficacy of EVs in addressing environmental concerns. This analysis seeks to explore and compare the key arguments from both articles, assessing their credibility and relevance within the broader discourse on sustainable transportation.

Pirani's article critically examines the UK government's prioritization of electric cars as a linchpin in its climate strategy. He contends that the government's emphasis on EVs, coupled with an extensive road-building program, falls short of the necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions. The article underscores a sense of urgency, dismissing the 2030 phase-out of petrol and diesel cars as a mere delaying tactic. Pirani advocates for an immediate and substantial shift towards public transport, cycling, and walking, arguing that electrification alone cannot achieve meaningful decarbonization. He asserts, ""Climate change requires immediate action, not a promise for action in ten years.""

In stark contrast, Chevron's article adopts a corporate standpoint, highlighting the company's commitment to researching and developing cleaner vehicles and fuels. Chevron acknowledges the benefits of EVs, particularly in urban areas, while cautioning against overlooking the environmental footprint inherent in all vehicles. The article contends that increasing fuel efficiency globally will have a more significant impact on curbing oil demand by 2040 than the widespread adoption of EVs. Chevron's inclusive approach to emissions reduction is emphasized, advocating for improvements in both internal-combustion engines and EVs to meet diverse consumer transit needs. The article concludes with Chevron's unwavering commitment to powering the world forward, irrespective of the chosen mode of travel.

In assessing the credibility of these articles, Pirani's piece draws on the voices of climate scientists and researchers, providing a critical examination of government policies. The urgency conveyed aligns with the broader scientific consensus on the immediacy of climate action. Chevron's article, representing a corporate perspective, lacks the specificity of life-cycle emissions for traditional vehicles and focuses more on the inclusive approach to emissions reduction.

Ultimately, the relevance of each article hinges on the priorities of the reader. Pirani's urgent call for immediate action resonates with those emphasizing the critical nature of the climate crisis. On the other hand, Chevron's perspective appeals to a broader, inclusive strategy, with a focus on corporate responsibility and investment in a variety of transportation technologies.

In conclusion, these articles contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on sustainable transportation. Pirani's urgency and scientific grounding provide a compelling argument for immediate action, while Chevron's corporate perspective highlights the importance of inclusivity and diversified approaches to emissions reduction. The reader's stance on the immediacy of action versus a broader, inclusive strategy will ultimately shape the perceived relevance of these contrasting viewpoints.","Hi ChatGPT.

651,1- Entirely written by me,Do an analysis of two articles with contrasting views.,Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by Human,33,Likely Human,43.42,0.02,7.2,"As the world population skyrockets, so does the carbon footprint of the world. Fuel-driven cars emit harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxides which contribute to climate change. For this purpose, scientists are trying to find more eco-friendly substitutes for fossil fuels. To postpone further harm, electric cars are catching up that emit zero emissions. But are they a good way to fight climate change? The articles ""Why aren't we all driving electric vehicles?""and ""Electric cars are no panacea""by Simon Pirani offer two opposing views. Whilst the former promotes the use of electric vehicles, the latter discourages the UK government's implementation.

""Why aren't we all driving electric vehicles?""is an article by the Chevron Advocacy Network which is a part of Chevron Corporation, an American multinational energy corporation. According to the sources, Chevron Corp. has a reputation for investing in clean, eco-friendly fuel options. Therefore they are investing in ChargePoint, ""one of the largest operators of electric-vehicle charging networks"". The article gives reasons for investing in EV charging; they are unbiased and logical, and the hyperlinks lead to official, renowned websites like the US Environmental Protection Agency.
The next article, ""Electric cars are no panacea""by Simon Pirani criticizes the government for focusing on Electric Vehicles in its ten-pointer plan. The UK government intends to end the sale of petrol and diesel-driven vehicles by 2030. The author doesn't acknowledge the benefits of climate conservation; he only looks for reasons to criticize the government. The article quotes climate scientists Kevin Anderson and Dan Calverley in response to the ten-point plan. ""Although the 2030 phase out of petrol and diesel cars is welcome, in reality, it is a delaying tactic""""Climate change requires immediate action, not a promise for action in ten years.""Laterally reading about Kevin Anderson and his tweet about electric vehicles, strangely, he agrees that they are better than petrol/diesel cars, especially electric bikes, which means Pirani only quoted Anderson for confirmational bias. I couldn't find much credible information about Caverley either. Pirani quoted their article probably because it is very polarised and critical just like their own.

Chevron invests in electricity generation because the Green House Gas emissions from electric vehicles is comparatively less than fuel-driven vehicles. ""Since EVs don't give off tailpipe emissions and make less noise than cars with internal-combustion engines, they may be great for use in urban areas."" ""Fortunately, as U.S. power plants switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas to generate electricity, GHG emissions have dropped."" This is a very reasonable argument. Contrary to this reasoning, some of the points of Pirani's article are not practical in today's scenario. Even though the UK government's new program is expensive right now, it will be beneficial to the environment in the years to come. Pirani basically wants people to stop using their cars and use the space taken by parked cars into green spaces, and as we all know how expensive the public transportation system is in the UK and many other countries in Europe, Pirani is leading us to financial downfall. According to their logic, people might be going through bankruptcy, but on the bright side, they can have a longer stroll in the park.
Chevron's article mentions in the Key Points of the article that all vehicles'including EVs' have an environmental footprint. This transparency is what sets this article apart from the other in terms of credibility. The tone of Pirani's article sounds biased and discouraging, and diving into their profile I found out that so are their other articles. Their unusually long article provides several sources to prove its point, but only a few of them seem credible. Most of the article is filled with different people's negative opinions on the government's policies, whilst the ones that do talk about electric cars are not thought through properly. For example, the article points out that the more a car weighs, the less is its mileage; but we also need to know that the heavier the car, the more robust and secure it is. From a bird's eye view, we might start believing this article, but when you look carefully, you can find the loopholes.
After carefully reading both articles, I have concluded that the ""Why aren't we all driving electric vehicles?""article is more credible than the ""Electric cars are no panacea""by Simon Pirani. They were both very well written and both argued in favor of the environment. It was difficult to measure their credibility because both had very strong arguments. But the first one was brief and concise and it did a great job of proving its point as to why the corporation was investing in electric vehicles. The second one also did a good job of putting forth its point, but it ended up sounding too biased and critical.",

I found it very interesting and appealing because it is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures that represent pairwise relations between objects. Graphs can be used to model many phenomena in various fields, such as computer science, biology, social sciences, and more.

I enjoyed learning about the different types of graphs, such as directed, undirected, weighted, bipartite, planar, and so on. I also liked learning about the properties and concepts of graphs, such as degree, connectivity, path, cycle, tree, subgraph, coloring, and more. Graph theory is a rich and diverse area of mathematics that has many applications and challenges.

One example of how graph theory is used in a real-world application is in network analysis. Network analysis is the study of how entities are connected and interact with each other, such as social networks, communication networks, transportation networks, and more. Graphs can be used to represent networks, where the vertices are the entities and the edges are the connections or interactions. For instance, in a social network, the vertices can be people and the edges can be friendships or followings. Graph theory can help us understand the structure and dynamics of networks, such as finding the most influential or central nodes, detecting communities or clusters, measuring the robustness or resilience of networks, and more. I was surprised to find that graph theory can be applied in such a way, because I did not expect that simple mathematical objects can capture complex real-world phenomena.

If I had to teach graph theory to the next MAT 206 class, I would try to make it as engaging and accessible as possible. I would start by introducing the basic definition and notation of graphs, and then show some examples of graphs that represent real-world situations, such as maps, games, puzzles, etc. I would also use some interactive tools or software, such as [Graphviz] or [Gephi], to visualize and manipulate graphs. I would then explain some of the key concepts and properties of graphs, such as degree, connectivity, path, cycle, tree, subgraph, coloring, and more, and show how they can be used to solve problems or answer questions. I would also give some exercises or quizzes to test their understanding and reinforce their learning. Some of the obstacles that I might expect in teaching graph theory are the following:

* Some students might find graph theory too abstract or difficult to grasp, especially if they are not familiar with the notation or terminology. I would try to overcome this by using concrete examples and analogies, and by providing clear explanations and definitions.

* Some students might find graph theory too boring or irrelevant, especially if they do not see the connection or application to their own interests or fields. I would try to overcome this by showing a variety of examples and applications of graph theory, and by relating it to their own experiences or goals.

* Some students might find graph theory too challenging or overwhelming, especially if they encounter some of the more advanced or complex topics or problems. I would try to overcome this by breaking down the topics or problems into smaller or simpler parts, and by providing hints or guidance along the way.

I found this class to be very enjoyable and informative. I learned a lot of new and interesting things about discrete mathematics, and I appreciated the way the class was structured and delivered. I liked the discussion posts, because they gave me an opportunity to share my thoughts and opinions, and to learn from other students' perspectives and insights. I also liked the quizzes, because they helped me review and practice what I learned, and to check my progress and understanding. The exams were fair and reasonable, and they tested my knowledge and skills in a comprehensive and balanced way.

With the class being online, I still felt a sense of community with my peers and the instructor. I think the discussion posts were a great way to interact and communicate with each other, and to create a friendly and supportive learning environment. I also appreciated the feedback and encouragement that the instructor gave me throughout the course, and the availability and responsiveness that he showed whenever I had a question or a concern. I think the instructor did a great job of facilitating and managing the online class, and of making it a positive and rewarding experience for me.

I hope this essay reflects my understanding and appreciation of graph theory and discrete mathematics.

",Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,33.7,0.02,10.33,"The topic I found most interesting was graph theory. I learned a little bit about it in my data structures computer science class last semester. As we learned the bare bones of it, it didn't seem too interesting. When Professor S. started going into the real-world uses of it, it fascinated me. You can apply graph theory to so many different areas of science and the real world. What are our social media networks if not graphs? Every person is an individual node. Every person you're friends with is connected by an edge. Every friend of a friend of a friend is connected through edges. Every time a person sends out a tweet, that message is pushed across all those edges to adjacent nodes. Every person can then retweet that message, pushing the message further through the graph.

 My professor also went into how it can be applied to the delivery systems of shipping companies. Shipping companies face the challenge of delivering millions of packages each day in an efficient way. They are looking to minimize costs and maximize speed. How do they choose which order to deliver packages in? How many vehicles should a company utilize for deliveries? Where should they place distribution centers and depots (to start deliveries at)? Graph theory can be applied to all those questions. Each problem can be modeled as a graph where nodes are delivery locations and edges are the streets between them. By applying graph theory algorithms, companies can find the most efficient routes for their deliveries. Graph theory can also be applied to GPS systems like Google Maps. GPS systems are based on the Dijkstra algorithm, named after Edsger Dijkstra. In a weighted graph (a graph with a start point and an end point within the graph), the algorithm finds the most efficient path between the two points. Most efficient in terms of the sum of the weights. The weights are the ""cost""to cross an edge, or in this case, travel time. The algorithm keeps track of all the nodes it visits and all the nodes it hasn't. Until it reaches the endpoint of the graph, it continually moves forward and backtracks until it finds the most optimal path for the graph. The discoveries in graph theory have pushed the world forward evermore. My professor also talked about how when she was in college at Rutgers (a very long time ago), she took a class dedicated solely to graph theory. It was incredibly complex back then; I wonder what breakthroughs have been made since then.

 If I had to teach this topic to a class, I would break down its uses in the real world first. Got to get them hooked. After that, I would have a glossary set for each definition. That's what graphs are at the beginning. Definitions, definitions, and more definitions‚Ä¶ (Actually, that's all of discrete math‚Ä¶) I'd try to have an example for what each definition means and how it is different from all the similar definitions. It's tricky to understand the differences between cycles, walks, and paths. Above all else, I'd make everyone do example problems to get it to stick in their heads.

 I found the class to be a solid introduction to discrete math. It's tough to feel a sense of community when you take an online class. I recognize some names in the discussion posts, and I've talked to some of those people in the other classes I have. I feel like it would've been way more fun in person, but it was my decision to take this online. I liked the book; it explained things in a way I could understand pretty quickly. I think it would've helped me more if I had more example problems to do, not just the ones in the book. The ones in the book are helpful, but sometimes they don't show the answer or how they got to the answer. Repetition helps in retaining this kind of stuff. I still feel like I learned a large amount of stuff, or at least, how to think ""logically.""Thank you for the class!",

Background on Israel's Intelligence Community (IC)

Israel, a country with a population of approximately 9.3 million, is led by a Prime Minister, currently Yair Lapid, and a President, currently Isaac Herzog. The evolution of Israel's IC reflects its unique geopolitical challenges and history. Israel's IC consists of several key agencies, each with distinct roles and focus areas:

*

Mossad: Responsible for foreign intelligence, covert operations, and counterterrorism. Mossad's primary focus is on gathering intelligence overseas and executing special operations.

*

Shin Bet (Shabak): Focuses on internal security, counterterrorism, and counterintelligence within Israel. It plays a crucial role in safeguarding Israel's internal stability.

*

Aman (Military Intelligence): The largest of the intelligence bodies, Aman handles military intelligence and is integral in providing strategic information regarding military threats.

The IC structure is designed to address a range of threats, primarily focusing on terrorism, espionage, and regional stability issues.

2. Balance Between Security and Privacy/Civil Liberties

Israel's approach to balancing security and privacy is heavily skewed towards security due to its unique security challenges. This often leads to controversies, especially in areas related to surveillance and civil liberties. For instance, the use of sophisticated surveillance technologies and data collection methods by Shin Bet for counterterrorism purposes has raised concerns over privacy rights and potential overreach.

Recent controversies include the use of advanced tracking technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor quarantined individuals, which was criticized for intruding into personal privacy. Despite these concerns, the Israeli public generally shows higher tolerance for security measures, given the constant security threats the nation faces.

3. Comparison with the United States IC and Effectiveness

Comparing Israel's IC with that of the United States reveals both similarities and differences. The U.S. IC is larger and more complex, consisting of 17 agencies, including the CIA, NSA, and FBI, each with distinct roles and jurisdictions. The U.S. IC covers a broader spectrum of global interests and threats, whereas Israel's IC is more regionally focused, primarily concentrating on Middle Eastern dynamics.

In terms of effectiveness, Israel's IC is often considered highly efficient, especially given its smaller size and more focused scope. Its ability to preempt threats and conduct successful covert operations is well-documented. The U.S. IC, while extensive and resource-rich, sometimes faces challenges due to its size and inter-agency coordination. Israel's IC, with its streamlined and integrated structure, offers a model of efficient intelligence operations focused on specific regional threats.

Conclusion

Israel's IC, characterized by its specialized agencies like Mossad, Shin Bet, and Aman, is a reflection of the nation's unique security needs and regional challenges. While its approach to balancing security and privacy often leans heavily towards security, this is largely influenced by the constant and immediate threats the country faces. Compared to the United States, Israel's IC is smaller but highly focused and effective in its objectives. Its efficiency and adaptability provide valuable insights into the functioning of a highly integrated and focused intelligence apparatus.","There are three sections your memo must address: Background on assigned country (for example: population, leaders, history/evolution of country's IC, IC organizational structure-how many agencies, what does each agency do/what type of threats does the IC focus on, etc.); Does the country strike a balance between security and privacy/civil liberties?

Background on Israel and the Israeli Intelligence Community:



Israel, a Middle Eastern nation of 9 million, surrounded and embroiled by external and internal conflicts, boasts one of the most robust, effective, infamous, and controversial intelligence communities in the world. The three primary entities in the Israeli intelligence community are as follows; The Mossad - the national intelligence agency, Aman - military intelligence, and Shin Bet - internal security. Israel's precarious geographic and political situation has led to prioritized intelligence gathering and covert operations to safeguard its existence. Since its establishment as a nation-state in 1948, Israel has engaged in conventional wars with neighboring enemy nations such as Lebanon and Syria, and the now allied nations of Jordan and Egypt. Additionally, since the failure of the Oslo Accords, Israel has faced significant security challenges from non-state actor terrorist groups on its borders such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Regional tensions with Iran have also led to various campaigns between the two nations, engaging in espionage, covert action, and cyber warfare.



Balance between national security objectives and civil liberties:



Israel as a democracy, has incrementally installed parliamentary oversight and legal controls for the governance of its intelligence community. This has proven to be a difficult balance to maintain due to the constant threats Israel faces to its continued existence and national security. Due to Israel not having a constitution, various laws have been enacted over the years oftentimes involving the declassification of covert operations to the public. This dichotomy between national security objectives and civil liberties has on more than one occasion, culminated in sensitive operational information being leaked. Israel is also the most infamous proliferator of spyware with software such as Pegasus and Predator being tied to Israeli intelligence through seemingly private companies such as NSO. Many have criticized Israel for collecting personal information and conversations from not only its citizen's phones, but also selling these capabilities to other nations, indirectly infringing on the rights and privacy of their citizens, but also those of allied nations and enabling autocratic regimes to siphon away even more personal freedoms from their citizens.



Threats to Israel:



Israel's threat landscape has taken on various forms throughout its history but has largely been built on the same foundational principle of destroying the state of Israel. This has propelled Israel into being the most militarized nation in the world according to the Global Militarisation Index. Israel's current primary threats are the designated terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Even more threatening to Israel is the current regime in Tehran. On multiple occasions, the IRGC have grown and funded terrorist groups on Israel's borders, threatened militaristic and nuclear action, and been embroiled in cyberwar with Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are funded in part by the Iranian regime alongside Qatari interests. Espousing similar ideologies of Islamic nationalism, antisemitism, and militaristic jihadism, these groups' primary objectives are the destruction of the state of Israel and the full-scale death of its people. Israel also faces current tensions with Assad's regime in Syria and the majority of political entities in Lebanon and Iraq indirectly.



Comparison between Israeli and American Intelligence:



American and Israeli intelligence agencies, while sharing a history of collaboration, display both similarities and differences in their operational approaches. In many cases the two have symbiotically worked together, such was notably the case when Israel in 2007 in collaboration with US intelligence, destroyed a North Korean-built nuclear reactor in Syria. Many senior intelligence officials in Israel have relevant work experience within the U.S. intelligence community and vice versa. In terms of differences, Israel's intelligence organizations operate more holistically within intelligence collection and covert action and are less tied to specificity than the seventeen agencies within the American IC. While Israel's Mossad does operate in foreign territories, it's much less focused on nation-building within hostile states, rather focusing on gaining actionable intelligence for an upper hand in a potential war, or a preemptive strike such as Israel's victory over five nations during the Six-Day War. Furthermore, Israeli intelligence is often more public about targeted killings and covert actions and takes a different stance regarding international law. Israel's Mossad can most easily be compared to the American CIA, similarly Aman functions like the various intelligence apparatuses of American military branches but as one singular unit. Shin Bet's focus on internal security, law enforcement, and border safety makes it comparable to America's FBI. Both the American and Israeli ICs are extremely effective, it is impossible to state which is more effective between the two as they have radically different goals, threats, and operations.

3253,4- AI-generated,Students will research and prepare a 1-page memo on one of the intelligence collection disciplines and present their findings in class.,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,88,Likely Human,50,0.02,38.55,"Subject: Comprehensive Analysis of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and its Modern Implications

Introduction Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), an indispensable intelligence collection discipline, involves the interception and analysis of electronic signals for intelligence and national security purposes. This memo offers a detailed examination of SIGINT, emphasizing its integration with cybersecurity, cyber operations, and its critical role within the Five Eyes alliance, COMINT, and ELINT.

*

SIGINT: Definition, Evolution, and Scope SIGINT, traditionally focusing on radio signal interception during wars, has evolved significantly. Now, it includes collecting data from various electronic sources, such as communications equipment, radars, and weapons systems. This evolution has been driven by technological advancements, changing the nature of global communications and warfare. SIGINT not only aids in understanding adversaries but also plays a pivotal role in formulating strategic defense and foreign policies.

*

Cybersecurity and Cyber Operations in SIGINT The digital revolution has significantly expanded the SIGINT landscape. Cybersecurity in SIGINT is about protecting the infrastructure used for intelligence collection, including safeguarding against cyber threats and ensuring secure communication channels. Cyber operations, encompassing offensive strategies like hacking into foreign networks, and defensive actions, such as protecting against cyber espionage, are increasingly intertwined with SIGINT efforts. These operations target electronic communication to gather actionable intelligence, requiring a blend of technical skills and strategic thinking.

*

The Five Eyes Alliance and Its Significance The Five Eyes, an alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, represents one of the most comprehensive SIGINT partnerships. This alliance underscores the importance of international cooperation in intelligence gathering. By sharing resources, methodologies, and collected intelligence, the Five Eyes countries achieve a level of SIGINT capability that significantly surpasses what each could achieve individually. This collaboration is pivotal in tackling global threats and enhancing mutual security.

*

COMINT: A Subset of SIGINT COMINT, focusing on intercepting and decoding communications between individuals, is becoming increasingly complex with the advent of sophisticated encryption technologies. Modern COMINT operations require not only traditional signal interception but also advanced cyber techniques to decrypt secure communications. The role of cybersecurity in COMINT is paramount in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the methods used for interception and analysis.

*

ELINT: Electronic Signals Intelligence ELINT, a crucial subset of SIGINT, focuses on intercepting non-communication electronic signals. This includes signals from radar, navigation systems, and other electronic devices. ELINT provides invaluable insights into the technical capabilities and deployment of adversaries' electronic systems, playing a vital role in national defense. The modern battlefield, characterized by advanced electronic warfare, underscores the importance of ELINT in strategic military planning.

Conclusion SIGINT's relevance in today's digital and technologically advanced world cannot be overstated. Its integration with cybersecurity and cyber operations is essential in navigating the complexities of modern communication technologies. The Five Eyes alliance and the distinct yet interconnected roles of COMINT and ELINT exemplify the multifaceted nature of SIGINT. As global communication landscapes continue to evolve, so will the strategies and techniques of SIGINT, making it an ever-more critical component in national and international security.

Note: This memo aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SIGINT.

Signals Intelligence, also known as SIGINT, is the intelligence discipline responsible for the aggregation of electrical signals pertinent to a nation's interests and affairs both domestically and internationally. Often the intelligence discipline that collects the largest amounts of information, SIGNIT relies on satellites, telecommunications devices, and information systems to collect large amounts of communications to process information to derive meaningful and insightful conclusions to aid decision-making in geopolitical issues. The various tasks of interception of communications and signals, analysis, dissemination of information, and reporting are the primary functions of a SIGINT operation. SIGINT is also the largest collection discipline within the intelligence community. SIGINT can be further broken down into Communications Intelligence (COMMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT). Signals Intelligence is also the primary collection discipline incorporated by The Five Eyes (FVEY), an intelligence alliance comprised of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Cyber operations and warfare:

Technologies relied on by SIGINT operators are the same computing and information systems that have led to cyber warfare operations and cybersecurity countermeasures. This has created a need for counter-intelligence efforts, leading to cybersecurity practices being put in place around SIGINT. According to Cyware, many well-known cybersecurity tools and technologies have been incorporated into SIGINT practices. These include SIEM (Security Information Event Management) tools for automation and aggregation of network traffic, and Lampstands, which can interfere with wireless connections over large distances. Threat intelligence, as a way to proactively track and monitor nation-state actors that pose a threat to national security, has also been incorporated within SIGINT operations. Signals can often be used for destructive purposes due to the modern world placing a hyper-reliance on radio signals and network technologies. The first step in any offensive or defensive cyber operation involves reconnaissance and information gathering. This makes the SIGINT not only relevant for gathering information but for also protecting information, critical infrastructure, and telecommunication technologies.

Future implications and conclusion:

SIGINT is exponentially increasing in scope, implications, and prevalence. According to the NSA, ""We must keep pace with advances in the high-speed, multifunctional technologies of today's information age. The ever-increasing volume, velocity and variety of current signals make the production of relevant and timely intelligence for military commanders and national policy-makers more challenging and exciting than ever.""This sentiment is directly indicative of a future where the technologies behind SIGINT are going to be even more dominant in their influence on the intelligence community. Presenting this also highlights a concern for operators handling such sensitive information in massive loads on both foreign interests and domestic civilians. According to the DNI, this presents an issue that needs to be overseen in a compliance manner. ""Agency policies and procedures shall include appropriate measures to facilitate compliance and oversight of the implementation of safeguards protecting personal information acquired through SIGINT activities.""Like many modern technologies, SIGINT technologies and information must be handled with proper oversight and caution to avoid disastrous consequences including counterintelligence, compromise of technical ability, and both legal and diplomatic repercussions.

8910,4- AI-generated,how was accident insurance commercialized in the 1800s?,History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,84,May Have AI,64.29,0.02,61.39,"The 19th century was a transformative era marked by industrialization, urbanization, and burgeoning economic activities. Within this landscape, the commercialization of accident insurance emerged as a response to the changing socio-economic dynamics, paving the way for a revolutionary approach to risk management and financial protection.

Prior to the 1800s, the concept of insurance primarily centered around maritime ventures and cargo protection. However, the rapid industrial growth and the increasing prevalence of accidents in factories, railways, and other industrial sectors highlighted the need for a specialized form of insurance to safeguard individuals against unforeseen mishaps.

The roots of accident insurance can be traced back to the growth of industrial towns and the rise of factory-based production. Workers faced hazardous conditions, and the risk of injury or death was significantly high. Employers sought ways to mitigate this risk while maintaining productivity, leading to the inception of accident insurance schemes.

The commercialization of accident insurance gained momentum through the pioneering efforts of insurance companies and individuals who recognized the potential market demand for such policies. One notable milestone was the establishment of the Railway Passengers Assurance Company in England in 1848, which offered compensation for injuries sustained by railway passengers.

Simultaneously, various European countries witnessed the establishment of mutual aid societies and guilds that provided financial assistance to members in case of accidents. These early forms of communal support laid the groundwork for the structured development of accident insurance.

In the United States, the advent of accident insurance took shape with the formation of companies like the Travelers Insurance Company in 1864, which initially focused on providing coverage for railway and steamboat accidents. These entities played a pivotal role in popularizing accident insurance and expanding its reach beyond industrial workers to encompass a broader spectrum of society.

The commercialization of accident insurance was further propelled by legislative initiatives and regulatory frameworks that recognized the need for protecting workers and individuals against unforeseen events. Governments introduced laws mandating employers to provide compensation or insurance coverage for workplace accidents, fostering the growth of accident insurance as a means of compliance.

Moreover, advancements in actuarial science and risk assessment techniques bolstered the viability and sustainability of accident insurance policies. Actuaries played a crucial role in calculating risks, premiums, and payouts, laying the foundation for a more structured and reliable insurance system.

The commercialization of accident insurance in the 1800s transformed the insurance landscape, shifting the focus from maritime ventures to a broader spectrum of risks faced by individuals in an evolving industrialized society. It not only provided financial protection but also contributed to the social welfare by ensuring a safety net for workers and their families in times of adversity.

In conclusion, the 19th century witnessed the evolution and commercialization of accident insurance as a response to the industrial revolution's challenges. The establishment of specialized insurance companies, legislative interventions, and advancements in risk assessment methodologies collectively propelled the growth of accident insurance, shaping it into a vital component of modern-day risk management and financial security.",It was generated using Chat GPT and the specific instructions I provided were to ask it to make sure it is in a typical essay format while also telling it to make sure it sounds and seems legit.

As the pandemic forced people into unaccustomed physical isolation, what role did technology play? Are you aware of technology affecting your free will? Or, has technology offered forms of freedom that Foer did not predict?",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by AI,94,Likely Human,46.43,0.03,0,"The global pandemic, an unprecedented event, thrust the world into a state of physical isolation, reshaping how individuals interact, work, and navigate daily life. Amidst this turbulent time, technology emerged as a crucial lifeline, providing avenues for connectivity, productivity, and entertainment. However, as we grappled with the necessity of technological reliance, questions arose about its impact on individual autonomy and free will.

The pandemic-induced isolation created a paradigm shift, compelling people to turn to technology for work, education, socializing, and accessing essential services. Video conferencing platforms became the virtual bridge that maintained social connections, enabling face-to-face interactions despite physical distances. Remote work and digital collaboration tools offered a semblance of continuity in professional spheres. Moreover, e-commerce and online services emerged as essential resources for procuring goods and accessing vital information.

In this context, technology played a dual role. On one hand, it offered a sense of freedom by enabling continuity in various aspects of life despite physical constraints. It granted individuals the liberty to stay connected, work remotely, and access necessities without leaving their homes. However, this newfound freedom came with its own set of implications.

Author Franklin Foer and others have raised concerns about the influence of large tech companies on individual free will. The increased dependence on digital platforms during isolation exposed individuals to algorithms and targeted content that could shape their choices and behaviors. The data-driven nature of these platforms often tailors information to suit individual preferences, creating echo chambers and reinforcing biases. Consequently, this raises concerns about the erosion of autonomy, as individuals might unknowingly fall victim to the algorithms' manipulation of their choices.

Moreover, the pervasive nature of technology during isolation heightened concerns about digital surveillance and privacy infringements. The extensive use of contact tracing apps and monitoring systems, although essential for public health, raised ethical dilemmas regarding data privacy and individual liberties.

However, amidst these concerns, technology also offered avenues of freedom that Foer might not have anticipated. It facilitated grassroots movements, activism, and the dissemination of information crucial for social awareness and change. Social media platforms became spaces for organizing protests, sharing resources, and amplifying marginalized voices, thereby empowering individuals to advocate for causes they believe in.

Furthermore, technology spurred innovations in telemedicine, enhancing access to healthcare services and breaking barriers of geographic distance. It empowered individuals to take control of their health, offering remote consultations and monitoring options, ensuring continuity of care during isolation.

As we navigate a post-pandemic world, the role of technology in shaping our lives remains pivotal. Acknowledging its potential to both restrict and enable free will is essential. Striking a balance between leveraging technological advancements for convenience and safeguarding individual autonomy and privacy is crucial.

In conclusion, the pandemic thrust technology into the forefront, offering both liberation and constraints. It underscored the significance of critically evaluating the impact of technology on individual free will. Moving forward, a conscientious approach in harnessing technology's potential while mitigating its adverse effects will be imperative in preserving individual autonomy in an increasingly digitized world.","It was generated using Chat GPT and the prompt that was provided was ""write me a essay on this prompt"""

While we were in the stages of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, we all relied on ""technology"". Whether it was scrolling for hours on TikTok or various other social media platforms, starting a side hustle/business, or most commonly, binge-watching the latest news coms and TV shows, we all can accept that technology was with us when nobody else was able to be. Experts' data reveals that since the start of the global lockdown, there has been an astonishing 100% surge in social media and internet activity. With the ever so positives of technology especially through a challenging time of a global pandemic, authors such as Franklin Foer of ""Mark Zuckerberg's War On Free Will"", argue that social media and the companies behind all of them are limiting our free will as users, being enticed into traps through the use of algorithms and various other tactics to make us think or act a certain way. What I see in contrast to Foer is the technologies and social media, in particular, have allowed for innovation and growth of individuals through knowledge, work, and better social life during tough times to create our better selves as digital media citizens of America.

Humans are being ever so dependent on technology for their daily lives. While the pandemic was raging with no sight of vaccinations soon and to the extent of not even being able to leave your house to take a walk in the park, technology was there for us to heal, grow, and learn. Foer states, ""Facebook paternalistically nudges users in the direction it deems best for them, which also happens to be the direction that thoroughly addicts them""(Foer 104). While Facebook does nudge users into a direction it believes is right for the user, it has led to greater growth rather than flaws. There has been more innovation and creativity through services provided by Facebook, for example, online streaming specifically for gaming and recreational purposes. People like you and I can live stream to countless countries and share or create memories like never before. Facebook recorded a milestone of an all-time high of 38,000,000+ viewers at a single time in May 2020 which is ridiculous in terms of popularity and a win-win for Facebook being able to connect us in finding new passions, hobbies, and even a new lifestyle we would have never perceived in a million years! While this may seem like an addiction to Foer, it is an aid for us to be our true authentic selves during a time of hardship and I believe that we should respect that and continue to explore its options for the future to come.

Foer delves deeper into the algorithmic aspects of technology where he states, ""If algorithms can replicate the process of creativity; then there's little reason to nurture human creativity""(Foer 114). What Foer fails to see in the creativity is that algorithms specifically are meant to take us to the deepest and most accurate levels of helping us grow and learn as individuals. During a time like the pandemic, applications such as TikTok allowed for the expression of free will more than ever and led to more creativity rather than limiting us. There was increased participation in trends whether it had to do with dancing to viral hit songs, creating arts and crafts, or even simple life hacks, everyone was touched by the content that was provided at a viewer's fingertips thanks to the algorithms. As a content creator myself, I was able to use the tools of technology algorithms to help me grow on various social media platforms through the use of analytic information based on impressions on previous videos and liked data, showing others what I love, and being myself. The tools of algorithms of these companies helped me stretch my videos and streams out to people who were interested in gaming and what I post. It even led me to the point of taking content creation seriously where it revived a lost hobby of mine and I am forever grateful for that.

As many students can agree, learning during the pandemic was a huge transition compared to our traditional roots. It was a difficult journey at first with balancing constant wifi issues and learning how to use new applications like Zoom but after a few weeks and a month or two, we were accustomed to this format and there were a multitude of benefits. As Foer responds, ""Why to bother with the torturous, inefficient process of writing or painting if a computer can produce something seemingly as good, in a painless flash?""(Foer 114), the computer and the technology built around it has, in turn, helped for greater success in the education aspect where we have more tools than ever at our fingertips for us to perform better in school or work. For example, YouTube which can help you solve math problems step by step, and tools like Grammarly which allow us to get help on better word choice, and automatic proofreading which I use the most. The pandemic was a span of learning how to adapt and grow on your own and the technology built by these companies provided aid in ensuring we can meet these goals and further expand on them.

As we go on to live a post-pandemic life for the future to come, we can all look back on the true positive effect technology has had on us. It opened up a new world for us to live upon through opportunity and growth as citizens of digital media America. It is all a matter of time as technology will continue to amaze us and educate us in ways we could never have imagined!",
2327,1- Entirely written by me,How was accident insurance commercialized in the 1800s,History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,C,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,30,0.02,20.6,"The mid-1800s led to an ever so increasing influx of population in many sectors of the
United States, primarily in many major cities across the nation which led to the drastic
implementation of many technological advancements, railroads being an example of one of
many. After all, with an ever-growing population, there was always a need for transportation
methods that were capable of handling the general population. As time went by, the deaths and
injuries started to increase alongside the number of trains and new rail routes being planned,
leading many passengers and workers to question how safe really were trains. The
implementation of accident insurance began in the 1860s and further progressed throughout the
late 1890s. An advertisement by New York Observer and Chronicle dated back to July 5, 1866,
highlighted the initial launch of Travelers Insurance Co, showcasing all the benefits while also
focusing on how accident insurance worked because the general public during this time was
severely undereducated on the meaning of an accident. On the other side of the horizon comes
almost 30 years later when a popular newspaper article, ""Another Swindling Game""by Omaha
World-Herald, dating back to December 26, 1897, specifically broadcasting the new
phenomenon of manipulation of accident insurance by working-class people and other higher
officials, in order to gain financial benefits while staying under the radar of law enforcement and
insurance policy regulations. Accident insurance went from being a great benefit for public
safety in the 1860s to a more profit-based manipulation venture towards the 1890s.
Statistical data shows that in the 1860s, the general public's definition of an accident had
shifted from being a natural phenomenon to a more statistical reasoning-based belief. There no
longer was an ""if""an accident was going to occur, but ""when""and accident insurance was a
great implementation during a time of people not knowing what risk really was. In the New York
Observer and Chronicle advertisement, the source states, ""Every man is liable to accident, no
matter what his occupation or pursuits, whether he travels much or none at all, whether he works
amid the whir and clatter of moving machinery, or in a store, lawyer's office or editors
sanctum.""1 Travelers' ideology allowed the general public to fear for their safety and reap the
benefits of accident insurance since it was very new to being with. Mohun also states, ""The
collision crisis represented a decisive shift in public discourse and collective risk perception. A
consensus formed: railroad travel was unnecessarily dangerous‚Äì not because of its ordinary
day-to-day risk, but because of the possibility of catastrophic wrecks.""2 Mohun's reasoning
provides a general viewpoint on railroad travel fear because passengers valued their life and
insurance was providing them with the safety for themselves and their family. Wrecks were too
common to the point where passengers refused to ride trains, and accident insurance was able to
help them make the decision to ride the trains and continue to work whether it was risky or not.
However by the 1890s, as the notion of accident insurance was introduced a couple of
decades, it provided certain individuals with enough knowledge of accident insurance to know
how to cheat the system. In Another Swindling Game, the news article states, ""There is a new
swindling game in the market. The insurance companies, of course, are the victims. Every rogue
and crook out of a dishonest job and in need of funds turns as naturally to an insurance company
for aid as a businessman turns to his banker.""3 Money seemed to be the biggest factor in most of
the working class people's lives as it was the source of solutions to their problems. Through the
3 ""Another Swindling Game,""Omaha World-Herald, December 26, 1897, p.7.

102.

news articles statement, we are able to identify that insurance companies like Travelers were
being taken advantage of because it provided the crooks, which in this case were the working
class individuals carrying out these illicit activities, with more money in their pockets, allowing
them to gain financial status and success, with the loss being taken by insurance companies.
Additionally, as noted by Professor Pietruska in last week's lecture, policies were handed out
within 5 minutes and required no screening or medical exams. Travelers insurance was also
covering almost all causes of physical harm from the processes of industrialization.4 Her quote
further highlights the notion of being able to swindle insurance companies because people were
able to gain a financial edge against the most popular companies without picking up any
attention. This then leads to insurance not being taken seriously anymore as it was in the 1860s
because the sense of fear that once was there, is now long gone.
Drawing to a close, through the industrialization of America, the implementation of
accident insurance came as a benefit to the general public but also a rather deceptive strategy for
others to gain financial benefits. The ""New York Observer Chronicle""focused on the rather
beneficial side of accident insurance when it first was implemented in the 1860s while ""Another
Swindling Game""depicted the new strategies of the working class ""crooks""that were prominent
in the 1890s. Railroads played a major role in the incorporation of accident insurance which
helped shape how risk was perceived by the general public in a time of mass transit and
population growth. Accident insurance definitely took multiple jumps and turns throughout its
journey during the 1860s and continuing on into the 1890s.",
3878,4- AI-generated,"In John Donne's poem ""Death Be Not Proud,""explain how Donne utilizes apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone to convey the speaker's complex attitude toward death",English,11th Grade,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,90,Likely Human,34.78,0.13,25.33,"John Donne's poem ""Death Be Not Proud"" is a sonnet that explores the speaker's complex attitude toward death. Through the use of apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone, Donne crafts a nuanced perspective that challenges conventional views of mortality and presents death as ultimately powerless.

Apostrophe, a literary device in which the speaker addresses an absent or imaginary person or abstract entity, plays a crucial role in the poem. Donne directly addresses death as if it were a sentient being, giving it human qualities and characteristics. By personifying death, the speaker engages in a dialogue with the very concept of mortality, challenging its assumed power. The opening line, ""Death, be not proud, though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadful,"" sets the tone for this direct confrontation with death. The speaker rejects the traditional perception of death as a fearsome force, immediately establishing a defiant stance.

The carefully chosen diction in the poem further contributes to the speaker's complex attitude toward death. Donne employs words such as ""proud,"" ""slave,"" and ""poison, war, and sickness,"" creating a vivid and varied lexicon that encompasses different aspects of mortality.The use of the term ""proud"" is particularly significant, as it challenges the conventional notion of death as an invincible force. The speaker's choice of words reflects a range of emotions, from scornful dismissal to a more contemplative examination of death's nature.

Syntax, the arrangement of words and phrases, is another tool Donne employs to convey the speaker's attitude toward death.The poem's structure is carefully crafted, with the opening lines challenging death's supposed might, followed by a series of metaphors that illustrate death's impotence. For example, the lines ""Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, / And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell"" highlight death's subservience to external forces. The deliberate arrangement of these ideas reinforces the speaker's argument against the conventional glorification of death.

The overall tone of the poem is both defiant and contemplative. The speaker confronts death with a sense of mockery, as seen in lines like ""And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die!""This bold declaration not only challenges the perceived authority of death but also implies a sense of triumph over mortality. However, beneath the bravado, there is a more reflective tone that acknowledges the inevitability of death. The speaker grapples with the complexities of mortality, suggesting that while death may not be as powerful as traditionally thought, it still holds a place in the human experience.

In conclusion, Donne's ""Death Be Not Proud"" utilizes apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone to convey the speaker's multifaceted attitude toward death. Through direct address, carefully chosen words, strategic arrangement of ideas, and a blend of defiance and reflection, Donne challenges the conventional view of death as an invincible force. The poem ultimately presents death as a transient and subservient aspect of existence, offering a complex and nuanced perspective on the nature of mortality.","ChatGPT 3.5

7267,1- Entirely written by me,"In John Donne's poem ""Death Be Not Proud,""explain how Donne utilizes apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone to convey the speaker's complex attitude toward death.",English,11th Grade,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,51,Likely Human,9.09,0.02,0,"In John Donne's poem ""Death Be Not Proud,""Donne utilizes apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone to convey the speaker's complex attitude toward death. The speaker uses apostrophe to address Death as if it is an actual person, instead of a natural occurrence. Describing Death in this manner allows him to dispute the people's common perception of it. He begins the poem by disparaging Death, claiming that it is not as ""Mighty and dreadful""as it attempts to be (l. 2). Normally, the speaker would use words such as mighty and dreadful to describe earthly entities. In this poem, the speaker confronts Death head-on as if he is in an argument with it. The speaker evokes a comparison to how ""poppy, or charms can make us sleep well,""to further weaken Death's fearsome reputation (l. 11). Overall, the speaker's anthropomorphized perspective of Death assists in providing a relatable aspect to his dismissive attitude.

The speaker's diction is another tool applied by Donne to diligently select the proper meaning of every word in the poem. Despite the unpleasant topic of Death in the poem, the speaker mainly uses positive words. The speaker's positivity displays how he remains unphased by Death. One example of this positivity is when he explains that death will bring us pleasure greater than sleep or rest; ""Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow""(l. 6). He believes the release of Death will cause more pleasure to flow than the amount we gain from our everyday slumber. The relatively optimistic outlook he has on Death reveals he is not going to let it stop him from living his life completely.

The syntax used by the speaker divides his poem into two separate parts. The start of the poem contains many enjambments, which resemble the tirade he is going on about Death. He is thinking of his reasons as he talks to back up his claims that challenge Death's reputation. His criticism continues until the end, where the caesuras apply an extra heaviness to his words: ""One short sleep past, we wake eternally, / And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die""(ll. 13-14). He proclaims his paradox, that only Death will die in the end. He also mentions death with a lowercase, referring to the idea, not the humanized form. After Death dies, there will be no more death. God will grant all people eternal life. The speaker does not worry about dying because he knows life on Earth is only a temporary holding ground before ascending to Heaven.

The speaker's tone is mocking and confrontational, taunting death as if he is impervious to it. The speaker mocks Death by calling it ""slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men""(l. 9). His comparison of Death to a slave unveils its sole function as a response to will and nature. Fate is the true determination of when a person dies and chance can be the reason someone lives longer or shorter. A king commands to have others executed and desperate men kill themselves through their own will. The speaker points out that Death only comes when other forces provoke it. When the speaker calls Death a slave, he is mockingly calling it powerless. This also contributes to his dismissive attitude. By employing apostrophe, diction, syntax, and tone in ""Death Be Not Proud,""Donne successfully conveys the speaker's complex attitude toward death.",

Fernicola.,Other,11th Grade,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,30,Likely Human,40.91,0.03,10.41,"In the book Twelve Days of Terror, author Richard G. Fernicola provides his deep insight and research into the 1916 shark attacks along the Jersey Shore, as well as covering some modern attacks. The focus of the book is the twelve-day span of shark attacks that took place during July of 1916, where four swimmers were mortally wounded and a fifth swimmer remained critically injured after his friends tore him away from the shark. I feel the chapter most crucial to the story was Chapter 3, which covers the Matawan shark attacks on July 12th. Eleven-year-old Lester Stilwell was playing in the Matawan Creek with his friends when they noticed a shark fin in the water. Before he and his friends could reach the water safely, the shark took hold on Stilwell and dragged him underwater. A nearby group of men dove into the water in an attempt to rescue Lester. One of the men, Stanley Fisher, found him and begin to carry him back to shore. His journey back was cut short when he too was attacked by a shark, eviscerating his right leg and causing him to lose the body of Stilwell. ""Despite all efforts, Stanley Fisher expired at 6:35 that evening. It was far too late to reverse the onset of uncompensated hemorrhagic shock""(63). Stilwell also succumbed to his wounds as his body was not recovered until two days later, on July 14th. The deaths of these two young men ignited a bloodthirsty vengeance in the residents of Matawan. Seeking revenge, ""The incensed crowd lay in wait with a hefty supply of dynamite, shotguns, harpoons, rifles, garden hoes, ice picks, axes, pitchforks, and even hammers""(62). The third chapter was key to the theme of the story and the storyline because it turned the people from being cautious after the death of Charles Bruder, the previous shark attack victim, to preparing to fight back and stop the shark's havoc.

These shark attacks are a tragedy that took the lives of four young men far too soon. Fortunately, the potential monster, a young great white shark captured by taxidermist Michael Schleisser, was killed and disemboweled to find human remains in its stomach, believed to be those of the late Lester Stilwell. Some believed this to be the so-called ""Jersey Man-Eater,""but others budded in with their own theories of what happened to the boys over that summer. Whether or not the shark caught by Schleisser was the cause of the terror, no attacks occurred after its capture. The story is very gruesome to read, hearing about the remaining shredded flesh and bone left on their mortal wounds. It's horrible to hear that someone would have ever had to endure such painful final moments. I was viciously attacked by my own dog, and while I'm lucky to be alive, I can't imagine the grief that was caused by these attacks. Hopefully, the mourning families could have their peace.",

Place's Concept of Consciousness: U.T. Place, a philosopher of mind, delves into the intricate nature of consciousness and its role in mental states. For Place, consciousness involves an introspective awareness or a subjective experience, distinguishing it from non-conscious mental processes. He characterizes conscious mental states by their qualitative, first-person aspect-what it feels like to experience something. These states possess a unique phenomenological dimension that sets them apart from purely behavioral or physiological occurrences.

Behaviorism and the Limits of Explanation: While Place acknowledges the explanatory power of behaviorism, particularly in understanding many non-conscious mental states, he draws a clear distinction when it comes to conscious mental states. Behaviorism, influenced by figures like Rudolf Carnap, emphasizes observable behaviors as the primary indicators of mental states. However, Place contends that behaviors alone cannot fully capture the essence of conscious experiences. Consciousness, according to Place, introduces an irreducible subjective element that eludes behavioristic analysis. The inner, personal aspect of consciousness resists translation into external, observable actions.

Identity and Rene Descartes' Influence: Place posits that conscious mental states are not amenable to behavioristic reduction but are, in fact, identical to brain states. This aligns with a form of identity theory, suggesting that specific brain states correspond directly to particular conscious experiences. Drawing a parallel, Rene Descartes, a foundational figure in philosophy, proposed a dualistic view, positing a connection between mental and physical realms. Descartes might argue that conscious mental states are identical to non-material substances, aligning with a mind-body dualism.

Establishing Identity: Place contends that establishing the identity between conscious mental states and brain states requires a thorough scientific investigation. He proposes that advances in neuroscience and neurophysiology are essential to mapping the neural correlates of consciousness. Identifying specific brain activities associated with distinct conscious experiences would provide empirical evidence for the identity theory he advocates. This scientific approach aims to bridge the explanatory gap between subjective experiences and neural processes.

Evaluation of Place's View: Place's perspective offers valuable insights into the challenges of understanding consciousness within the framework of behaviorism. His emphasis on identity theory opens avenues for interdisciplinary research, encouraging collaboration between philosophy and neuroscience. However, critiques emerge regarding the feasibility of entirely reducing consciousness to neural activity. Some argue that the subjective, qualitative nature of consciousness may resist complete translation into neurophysiological terms. While Place's call for empirical investigation is justified, questions persist about whether this approach can entirely capture the richness and diversity of subjective experiences.

In conclusion, U.T. Place's exploration of consciousness navigates the complexities of mental states, emphasizing the unique nature of conscious experiences. His critique of behaviorism and advocacy for an identity theory aligned with neuroscience represent a significant contribution to the philosophy of mind. However, ongoing debates center on the extent to which neural processes can fully account for the multifaceted dimensions of consciousness. Place's legacy lies in sparking dialogue and research endeavors that continue to shape our understanding of the intricate relationship between mind and brain.",This essay was written by ChatGPT.

His version of functionalism, often referred to as Machine Functionalism, offers an alternative perspective to the identity theory, challenging the notion that mental states are identical to physical or chemical states of the brain.

Hilary Putnam's Machine Functionalism: Putnam's functionalism is rooted in the idea that mental states are not solely dependent on physical or chemical properties but are defined by their functional roles within a system. In other words, mental states are identified by the roles they play in the overall cognitive functioning of an organism. This approach allows for the possibility that different physical states could give rise to the same mental state, emphasizing the functional organization and interactions within a cognitive system.

Unlike the identity theory, which posits a direct correspondence between mental states and brain states, Putnam's functionalism opens the door to multiple physical realizations of the same mental state. This flexibility aligns with the idea that mental processes can be realized not only in biological brains but also in artificial systems like computers, leading to the term ""Machine Functionalism.""

Divergence from Identity Theory: The identity theory proposes a one-to-one correspondence between mental states and specific brain states, asserting that every mental state is identical to a particular brain state. Putnam challenges this reductionist view, arguing that mental states are multiply realizable. His famous ""multiple realizability"" argument suggests that the same mental state can be realized by various physical systems, not limited to the specific chemical compositions of the human brain.

Putnam's functionalism is more inclusive, allowing for the possibility of intelligent beings with mental states that might not share the same biological substrate as humans. This departure from the strict materialism of the identity theory enables a broader understanding of cognition and consciousness.

Advantages of Machine Functionalism: Putnam argues that Machine Functionalism is superior to the identity theory because it accommodates the dynamic and evolving nature of cognitive processes. As our understanding of artificial intelligence and cognitive science progresses, the flexibility of functionalism becomes increasingly relevant. If mental states are solely tied to specific brain states, it becomes challenging to account for the potential emergence of intelligent systems that do not possess a human-like biological structure.

Moreover, Machine Functionalism provides a more intuitive framework for understanding mental states in diverse entities, reinforcing the idea that the essence of cognition lies in the functional roles performed by mental states rather than their specific physical instantiation.

Ned Block's Objection: Ned Block, another influential philosopher of mind, presents an objection to functionalism, including Putnam's version. Block introduces the notion of ""Chinese Nation,"" a hypothetical system that simulates human cognition on an immense scale. According to Block, while this system might exhibit functional organization similar to human cognition, it lacks genuine consciousness.

Block's objection raises questions about whether functionalism captures the full depth of subjective experience and qualia. The Chinese Nation scenario challenges the claim that any system, regardless of its functional organization, could possess true consciousness. This objection suggests that there may be more to consciousness than mere functional roles and that certain subjective aspects of experience may not be captured by functionalist theories.

Evaluation: The debate between Putnam's Machine Functionalism and Block's objection highlights the ongoing complexity of understanding the mind. While Putnam's functionalism offers a comprehensive account of mental states, Block's challenge reminds us of the intricacies involved in bridging the gap between functional roles and subjective experience.

In conclusion, Putnam's Machine Functionalism presents a compelling alternative to identity theory by embracing the diversity of physical realizations of mental states. However, Ned Block's objection underscores the need for a more nuanced exploration of consciousness. The ongoing dialogue between these perspectives contributes to the rich tapestry of philosophical inquiry into the nature of the mind, pushing us to refine our understanding of cognition and consciousness. As the field advances, the synthesis of functionalist insights and considerations of subjective experience may pave the way for a more comprehensive theory of the mind.",This essay was generated by ChatGPT.

Namely, it will explore Putnam's version of functionalism as described in his paper titled The Nature of Mental States. Many philosophers have argued whether or not mental states are brain states, and the concept of pain is often used by these philosophers to argue for either side of the debate. While some philosophers have tried to maintain that pain is, in fact, a state of the brain, Putnam argues in this paper that these ""brain-state theorists,""to use Putnam's words, are wrong, and that there is a better explanation of what pain is (and by extension, what mental states are). Rather than being a brain state, Putnam argues that pain is a functional state, and he does so in an interesting way.

 Before exploring what Putnam's version of functionalism is, it may be helpful to give a general overview of functionalism as a whole. Functionalism essentially characterizes mental states as functional roles that have relationships with other mental states, as well as with sensory inputs and motor outputs. In other words, according to functionalism, mental states are defined by what they do, rather than by how they are physically implemented. An example that can be used to illustrate this is with computer programming languages. Suppose a programmer wanted to create a program that takes a list of 10 numbers and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list. If he decided to create this program in Java, the code would look quite different compared to if he had created it in Python. Even though the physical implementation of the program would be different between the two languages (the ""physical implementation""in this case being the code that the programmer wrote), both implementations successfully realize a program that calculates the sum of 10 numbers in a given list. In the same way that a computer program can be written in many different ways, organisms can have different internal structures that allow them to feel pain.

 Now I will discuss Putnam's version of functionalism, which is now known as ""Machine functionalism.""This is because Putnam describes organisms as Turing machines, which are models of some kind of system defined by a Machine Table of functional states and transition states. While Putnam begins with Turing machines, he then turns to a more general version of the Turing machine: Probabilistic Automata. A Probabilistic Automaton also follows a Machine Table, however, unlike a Turing machine, the functional states change based on probability, and are not deterministic. Probabilistic Automata are more useful for Putnam's argument than Turing Machines, as their ability to change states based on probability more accurately describes organisms. Putnam also adds the condition that sensory inputs, in addition to the current state, play a role in how the state will change, as well as what the motor output will be. Putnam believes that all organisms are Probabilistic Automata, and that being in pain is simply being in the appropriate functional state along with having the appropriate sensory inputs.",

More generally, what is right and/or wrong about Place's view?",Other,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,4,Likely Human,50,0.15,16.9,"  This paper discusses the work of U. T. Place. More specifically, it explores his ideas in his paper Is Consciousness a Brain Process?, where he argues for the idea that consciousness is a brain process. It is the goal of this paper to explain the views in his paper in a way such that even the uninformed reader can understand Place's beliefs on the subject of consciousness and how it relates to the brain.
  A good place to start, then, would be to define consciousness in terms of Place's beliefs. Place explains that, in the behavioristic view, consciousness is either a special type of behavior (one that can't be explained by observation alone), or simply a disposition to behave in a certain way (Place illustrates this second point by comparing it to an itch being a disposition to scratch). While Place concedes that, for certain mental states, the behavioristic view is valid, he is adamant in arguing that the same can't be said for other, ""conscious""mental states, such as experience, sensation, and mental imagery. What sets these conscious mental states apart from others, which Place defines as states such as wanting, believing, and remembering, is that they seem to require an ""inner process story.""That is, these states cannot be explained only by behavioristic observation of a subject, so there must be something going on within the subject to explain these states. This ""inner process story""can be explained simply as ""subjectivity.""In other words, according to Place, experience, sensation, and mental imagery are all mental states that fall under the category of consciousness, and the property that makes them all states of consciousness (and thus what defines consciousness) is subjectivity of these states.
  It is this property of subjectivity that leads Place to believe that experience, sensation, and mental imagery are ""conscious""mental states. It follows, then, that Place found the other mental states (wanting, believing, remembering, and more) to be objective. This is why he believes those other mental states can be adequately explained by behavioristic analysis. For example, a behaviorist could determine that a person believes that it is cold based on their behavior of wearing a jacket. Such an observation would satisfy Place, but trying to explain the conscious mental states of experience, sensation, and mental imagery in behavioristic terms would not. This is because these mental states are subjective, and as such, are not able to be explained by observing behavior alone. The following examples of experience, sensation, and mental imagery may help to illustrate why Place holds this belief.
  There is the example of lucid dreaming, dreams in which the person realizes that they are in a dream. As a result of this realization, they become conscious inside of the dream, and can exert conscious control over the dream. Imagine a man who is fast asleep and finds himself in one of these lucid dreams, as conscious as he would be if he were awake. He might walk around, talk to people within his dream world, or even jump off a rooftop and soar through the sky like a superhero. However, from the perspective of a behaviorist watching him, the man is asleep and unmoving, and thus couldn't be having a conscious experience. However, he is in fact having a conscious experience within his dream, but there is no behavior that could be observed to make that conclusion. As such, the ability of behaviorism to explain experience is doubted by Place.
A good example to illustrate the subjectivity of sensation is with the sensation of pain. Imagine a man who is alone in his house when he suddenly trips and twists his ankle. He may shout out in pain, swear, start taking heavy breaths, and grab at his ankle. A behaviorist could observe this behavior and reasonably conclude that the man is in pain. However, now imagine this same man in the middle of a busy street. Once again, he trips and twists his ankle, but out of fear of drawing attention to himself and becoming embarrassed, he simply stands up and continues walking as if nothing happened. Would the behaviorist argue that the man is not in pain in this case? Of course, that assessment would very likely be wrong, and highlights Place's argument that sensations can't be observed by behavior alone.",

The Weeknd is a Canadian singer, songwriter, producer and his full name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye. In the past, Tesfaye has admitted to abusing many different types of drugs such as ketamine, cocaine, and more. He also had a rough past of experiencing homelessness and relied on other distracting ways to find pleasure during dark times. In August 2021, he talked about his sober lifestyle indicating he has stopped using drugs in the Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine. The Weeknd's dark and explicit lyrics are directly translated from Abel Tesfaye's personal experiences in life. His songs are centralized on serious and dark themes such as escapism and melancholia.



Tesfaye's song targets listeners who come from various and different backgrounds but they all happen to suffer and deal with similar and difficult problems in life. Those who suffer from hardships in life and use substances or partake in other activities in order to distract themselves from reality will strongly relate to the Weeknd's identity as he constantly talks about these issues in his songs. I do relate to the artist since I have struggled with such mental issues since high school and they have taken a huge part of my life.



Many of the listeners thought the song ""Starboy""directly targeted the audience as the lyrics conveyed that he, the Weeknd, underwent a transformation into who he is now, a Starboy. However, in the beginning of the music video, someone murders the Weeknd and then is revealed at the end of the video. The killer is the Weeknd himself but with a different look as he has a new haircut and signifies him throwing his old self away and evolving as a new and changed person. The song had commercial appeal because it contained both elements of familiarity and originality which attracted a massive following. Also, the other artist he collaborated with named Daft Punk was on a hiatus prior to making this song so people were excited to listen to Daft Punk as well. Starboy's melancholic and dark themes paired with some Funk vibes are what makes it stands out from today's mainstream hits.



Starboy is also a concept album featuring eighteen songs that reveal the Weeknd's raw and vulnerable side to him. The Weeknd also performed Starboy in various shows such as Saturday Night Live, 2016 American Music Awards, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to help promote his album. In addition to his live performances, he also created a short 12 minute film named Mania featuring quite a few of his songs.



In the song, leading up to each chorus, there is a thinning out of the last two beats of the pre chorus which helps establish the sharp contrast between each chorus. This also adds a stronger impact for the beginning of each chorus as the chorus marks his transformation as a Starboy. In order to keep the song engaging, the song is sectioned into multiple high energy levels paired with diminishing energy levels at times.",
7641,1- Entirely written by me,"""Soldier's Home"" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway about an American officer who returned home late in Oklahoma after finishing serving in World War I (WWI). The main character is Harold Krebs and he lives at the homes of his loved ones. He got home later than most other officers did, so he passed a wonderful opportunity to give all the lovely welcome to the soldiers who had already gone home. The story describes the reality of his inability to re-immerse himself in the society he used to be a member of a long time since he was a kid. Conflict is a rather important part of the story when the reader is drawn to the conflicts resulting from stressful situations and the struggles between the inner and the outer mind that the protagonist tried to escape. In Hemingway's story, Krebs is a young man who has just come from a war and is currently encountering a difficult situation to adapt to civilian life after the wartimes. Eventually, Krebs have to live a life of solitude, alienating himself from love, ambition, societal relationships, and religion.



Society is a mirror image of protagonist Krebs and has contributed significantly to the conflict seen in the story. The townsfolk considered Krebs returning too late from the battle as a strange thing to them. In other words, it was because of that problem that led to lying ideas gradually appearing several times out of his mind and even from Krebs's deep down. This is evident throughout the Solider's home story through the way of speaking, manners, and the reactions of the main character. Krebs predicts an epic welcome as a true hero after experiencing brutal and fierce battles on the battlefield, but the result he gets is indifference, apathy, and alienation from people in his home town. It may not have been possible for people to understand the fact that the trauma and the aftermaths of the traumatic war have had profound effects on the emotional and physical circuits of Krebs. This gave rise to a feeling of betrayal and the feeling of rejection in him that came from the very country he was born and raised in; he may have died miserably in the war, but no one admits him or admits what he did, such as the sacrifice of his youth and dedication to the country by Krebs. Krebs's problems in the story have emerged from the fact that it was based on after he returned home, ""to be listened to at all about his experiences in the war he had to lie and after he had done this twice he, too, had a reaction against the war and against talking about it.""While it might seem extreme and a bit annoying to attribute such loss of self to some essentially blatant lie and a bit of a loss of his genuine feelings as well, and also providing additional reasons to investigate how the lie worked through Krebs's mind and in the story. This is evident which is in the first lying appearing near the beginning of the story, when the narrator remarked that, after returning home from the war, Krebs twice exaggerated his story by speaking. That little thing happened to the soldiers other than the fact that there were things that seemed to have happened to him in a much more horrifying and haunting way. The narrator then insisted, ""An indescribable aversion to all that happened to him in the war due to the lies he had said. All the times could make him feel cool and pure thinking about them; a long time back when he did one thing, the only thing a man could do easily and spontaneously when he could have done something else were now losing their precious, calm qualities and then lost themselves ""(Hemingway). In other words, the narrator is implying that, by lying about his own past, Krebs was essentially poisoned his connection and relationship with the times spent in his life when he acted with dignity, honor as a true man as well as being a real soldier. And because in poisoning that connection, he lost that powerful aspect of himself, which was the only significant aspect that counted. The implication here is that lying is such a bad act, and it doesn't fit a standard man to the point that, in fact, it could disrupt v√† ruin one's ability to continue being an honestly mature man.



The second factor contributing largely to the conflict in the story is Krebs's family. Krebs no longer felt at home. Everything seemed strange and there was a clear distance to him. There was a difference in words and thoughts that no one could afford to Krebs's feelings. His mother could not understand the fact that he suffered and struggled during the war. She tried to persuade Krebs to find work like other men. We can sympathize with the pain of a mother wishing for her son a stable job, getting married, having children, and living a happy life. It is an obvious fact that every mother wants the best for her children. Besides, Krebs no longer had faith in God. His faith had become shaken and his bond with God was no longer tight. Krebs has lost a lot of things since the war, such as religious beliefs, feelings that have no meaning to him. As the story progresses, Krebs is forced to try to reconnect with his family. One morning, when his mother tried to persuade him to participate more fully in social life, she forced her mouth to ask the following question: ""Don't you love me, dear son?"" (Hemingway, 125); to which he honestly replied, ""No ... I don't love anyone"" (125). He couldn't hold back what he accidentally said. Krebs couldn't stop the true feelings in his mind, and that kept his mother from crying. However, Krebs responded by lying once more, and for a moment he realized that he felt disgusted by doing so. Krebs's mother was heartbroken when she heard the words from her own son. She did not seem to understand at all about the deep humiliation her son was facing when forced to lie. Tears blurred her mind. He pretended saying love his mother, and he called her a 'mummy', tried to be a good son, always pra to God and kisses her; but in the end, this achieves nothing but much faster escape from home. Krebs gradually became accustomed to lying about the matter, which eventually led to disgusting it because the lie was so blatant and unthinkable. His deception in sensationalizing the reality of war consumed his conscience. Krebs's conscience cannot restrain lies so many times which is a fact is permanently a fact that we cannot lie and change the truth. Author Hemingway borrowed the image and personality of the main character to portray the certain mood, thoughts, and feelings of the ancient soldiers and also wanted the reader to understand how difficult the soldiers had been gone through the wartime.

Krebs not only denied religion but also denied feelings of any relationship with girls. He lost his romanticism and his definition of love in war. Perhaps, scenes he encountered during World War I, such as the battle that took place at Belleau Wood, Soissons, and in Argonne and all of the things that he had been done during those battles which were truly hurt him so bad and made him lose part of his feelings. Another reason why he didn't want to build any relationships with girls was s the desire to avoid the consequences or bad luck that comes with his married life. He recalled the French and German women he had met in the military because their relationships with them were not complicated and had no consequences. Not even talking to them means there was no room for any consequences. However, he mentioned that ""he will like a girl if she took the initiative with him and intended to talk"". But he didn't want to chase or did anything drastic to get her attention. This really contradicts the unusual and the opposite way of thinking in his mind. ""Krebs admired girls but their charm disappeared when he met them in the city center. After all, he was looking for a life with no complications, no consequences, or does he truly crave love? The elaborate exploitation of flirting and basic marriage was not for him. Furthermore, he did want to live together without any consequences and annoyances. For Krebs to ask a girl would be a risk. It will lead to complications; whether a thing is good or bad, and taking risks were not worth it. ""Krebs did not want to be disturbed; just looking at the girls on the street was good enough to him."" He could keep his mind at ease by avoiding girls and his role as a watcher or just a momentary amount of time that makes him feel safe. While Krebs was still in the safe area on the front porch, he was protected by the peace and the moment of freedom. ""The girls walked across the street; nothing could touch him, and taking a look at them just like strangers walking through Krebs's life"". Krebs now does not have to follow any social norms or rules. Not outside any of the community's commands. No matter how his mother tried to draw him back into society such as suggesting that he could ask the girls out for the ride on the car that he had been had his heart on it for a long time ago since he was a child. Krebs remains unaffected by the fact that his father has authorized the use of the car, although as a child he often expected with the desire to acquire it. Overall, nothing seems to work. That shows clearly that he has no expectations or anything from life or perhaps not the right time for him to be ready to take action for the next goals in life.



Another value that is widely accepted by society, but rejected by Krebs, is his ambition to live. All other veterans have found a suitable position and a way to adapt themselves to civilian life and community, but Harold needs more time to find out what kind of goals he might need to do. Time is the key for Krebs to regain connection and rebalance everything in his life. After coming home from the war, he spent a lot of time on himself that he hadn‚Äôt been able to do since joining the army such as waking up late, reading books, playing billiards, going for a walk, and watching girls across the street. His attitude and manners toward his life make his parents start worrying. As Hemingway pointed out, ""Mrs. Krebs has shown blind faith and along with a traditional ambition for her son which is a valuable job and a favorable marriage with a girl. Her son's desire for life is the same as many other boys. Therefore, Krebs could not find peace but only conflict and tensions in the house. Because no one can sympathize with him. Krebs needs to adjust and arrange his life to find himself again. However, a month after he returned, his mother began to put pressure on him to become a real contributor and helpful man in the community. She was portrayed as a mother who wished for all the best things for Krebs, but blind to his emotional needs and did not care about his feelings. She also made her father's observation that his father would approve him to do any kind of work as long as he only needed one job to support himself since there was no shameful job. That also shows the conflict is growing bigger: from one side the family is trying to help him become more involved and opening his mind to society, from the other Krebs refusing the merits that are very common in his hometown. The growing tensions between Krebs and his parents created a barrier to their bond. In other words, it was as if there was an invisible string separating Krebs from society and from his loving family. Hence, this is exactly what happened to Hemingway when he lived with his parents as well as what happened to the character Krebs. Hemingway made a decision to move out like Krebs after his twenty-first birthday, in order to go away from the complicated life, troubles, and at the same time flee from family and society. This could be the explanation for Hemingway's use of Krebs to express his disgust for family life after returning from the war.



Over the course of the tale, readers‚Äô perceptions have been consciously clarified and discerned about the growing conflict between Krebs's personal faiths and societal norms of adherence from him. The moment he returned, the society asked him to contribute useful ideas for community life. His family is anxious about his social isolation even though they do not seem to understand how much a serious psychological problem has affected him mentally. His traumatic wartime experiences nurtured some sort of numbness that kept him from enjoying the simple and familiar things in life. The obsession of war is truly a cruelty for the soldiers of the war. This is a direct example of the process of destroying the humanity during the wartime for the human mind. Furthermore, the story also examines the reaction of society to a person who has been hurt by war. The story, however, still fails to resolve the characters' inner conflicts and Krebs is unable to resist social indifference. Krebs lacks the strength and bravery to obey and conform to the norms of society since ar has taken away any kind of feelings he might had about life. In the end, the story is ironic that it doesn't give any hint as to what Krebs's life will be like in the future, except that he plans to move to Kansas, a place where he won't be obligated to comply with social and family rules and where he can live a peaceful life without any complexity of the emotional ties. The decision to leave may be the right thing to do so that he could balance everything between himself and social traditions, and it also shows he needs to get rid of a system he no longer believe in.",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,40,Likely Human,37.98,8.15,0,"""Soldier's Home"" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway about an American officer who returned home late in Oklahoma after finishing serving in World War I (WWI).

This is evident which is in the first lying appearing near the beginning of the story, when the narrator remarked that, after returning home from the war, Krebs twice exaggerated his story by speaking. That little thing happened to the soldiers other than the fact that there were things that seemed to have happened to him in a much more horrifying and haunting way. The narrator then insisted, ""An indescribable aversion to all that happened to him in the war due to the lies he had said. All the times could make him feel cool and pure thinking about them; a long time back when he did one thing, the only thing a man could do easily and spontaneously when he could have done something else were now losing their precious, calm qualities and then lost themselves ""(Hemingway). In other words, the narrator is implying that, by lying about his own past, Krebs was essentially poisoned his connection and relationship with the times spent in his life when he acted with dignity, honor as a true man as well as being a real soldier. And because in poisoning that connection, he lost that powerful aspect of himself, which was the only significant aspect that counted. The implication here is that lying is such a bad act, and it doesn't fit a standard man to the point that, in fact, it could disrupt v√† ruin one's ability to continue being an honestly mature man.



The second factor contributing largely to the conflict in the story is Krebs's family. Krebs no longer felt at home. Everything seemed strange and there was a clear distance to him. There was a difference in words and thoughts that no one could afford to Krebs's feelings. His mother could not understand the fact that he suffered and struggled during the war. She tried to persuade Krebs to find work like other men. We can sympathize with the pain of a mother wishing for her son a stable job, getting married, having children, and living a happy life. It is an obvious fact that every mother wants the best for her children. Besides, Krebs no longer had faith in God. His faith had become shaken and his bond with God was no longer tight. Krebs has lost a lot of things since the war, such as religious beliefs, feelings that have no meaning to him. As the story progresses, Krebs is forced to try to reconnect with his family. One morning, when his mother tried to persuade him to participate more fully in social life, she forced her mouth to ask the following question: ""Don't you love me, dear son?"" (Hemingway, 125); to which he honestly replied, ""No ... I don't love anyone"" (125). He couldn't hold back what he accidentally said. Krebs couldn't stop the true feelings in his mind, and that kept his mother from crying. However, Krebs responded by lying once more, and for a moment he realized that he felt disgusted by doing so. Krebs's mother was heartbroken when she heard the words from her own son. She did not seem to understand at all about the deep humiliation her son was facing when forced to lie. Tears blurred her mind. He pretended saying love his mother, and he called her a 'mummy', tried to be a good son, always pra to God and kisses her; but in the end, this achieves nothing but much faster escape from home. Krebs gradually became accustomed to lying about the matter, which eventually led to disgusting it because the lie was so blatant and unthinkable. His deception in sensationalizing the reality of war consumed his conscience. Krebs's conscience cannot restrain lies so many times which is a fact is permanently a fact that we cannot lie and change the truth. Author Hemingway borrowed the image and personality of the main character to portray the certain mood, thoughts, and feelings of the ancient soldiers and also wanted the reader to understand how difficult the soldiers had been gone through the wartime.

Krebs not only denied religion but also denied feelings of any relationship with girls. He lost his romanticism and his definition of love in war. Perhaps, scenes he encountered during World War I, such as the battle that took place at Belleau Wood, Soissons, and in Argonne and all of the things that he had been done during those battles which were truly hurt him so bad and made him lose part of his feelings. Another reason why he didn't want to build any relationships with girls was s the desire to avoid the consequences or bad luck that comes with his married life. He recalled the French and German women he had met in the military because their relationships with them were not complicated and had no consequences. Not even talking to them means there was no room for any consequences. However, he mentioned that ""he will like a girl if she took the initiative with him and intended to talk"". But he didn't want to chase or did anything drastic to get her attention. This really contradicts the unusual and the opposite way of thinking in his mind. ""Krebs admired girls but their charm disappeared when he met them in the city center. After all, he was looking for a life with no complications, no consequences, or does he truly crave love? The elaborate exploitation of flirting and basic marriage was not for him. Furthermore, he did want to live together without any consequences and annoyances. For Krebs to ask a girl would be a risk. It will lead to complications; whether a thing is good or bad, and taking risks were not worth it. ""Krebs did not want to be disturbed; just looking at the girls on the street was good enough to him."" He could keep his mind at ease by avoiding girls and his role as a watcher or just a momentary amount of time that makes him feel safe. While Krebs was still in the safe area on the front porch, he was protected by the peace and the moment of freedom. ""The girls walked across the street; nothing could touch him, and taking a look at them just like strangers walking through Krebs's life"". Krebs now does not have to follow any social norms or rules. Not outside any of the community's commands. No matter how his mother tried to draw him back into society such as suggesting that he could ask the girls out for the ride on the car that he had been had his heart on it for a long time ago since he was a child. Krebs remains unaffected by the fact that his father has authorized the use of the car, although as a child he often expected with the desire to acquire it. Overall, nothing seems to work. That shows clearly that he has no expectations or anything from life or perhaps not the right time for him to be ready to take action for the next goals in life.



Another value that is widely accepted by society, but rejected by Krebs, is his ambition to live. All other veterans have found a suitable position and a way to adapt themselves to civilian life and community, but Harold needs more time to find out what kind of goals he might need to do. Time is the key for Krebs to regain connection and rebalance everything in his life. After coming home from the war, he spent a lot of time on himself that he hadn‚Äôt been able to do since joining the army such as waking up late, reading books, playing billiards, going for a walk, and watching girls across the street. His attitude and manners toward his life make his parents start worrying. As Hemingway pointed out, ""Mrs. Krebs has shown blind faith and along with a traditional ambition for her son which is a valuable job and a favorable marriage with a girl. Her son's desire for life is the same as many other boys. Therefore, Krebs could not find peace but only conflict and tensions in the house. Because no one can sympathize with him. Krebs needs to adjust and arrange his life to find himself again. However, a month after he returned, his mother began to put pressure on him to become a real contributor and helpful man in the community. She was portrayed as a mother who wished for all the best things for Krebs, but blind to his emotional needs and did not care about his feelings. She also made her father's observation that his father would approve him to do any kind of work as long as he only needed one job to support himself since there was no shameful job. That also shows the conflict is growing bigger: from one side the family is trying to help him become more involved and opening his mind to society, from the other Krebs refusing the merits that are very common in his hometown. The growing tensions between Krebs and his parents created a barrier to their bond. In other words, it was as if there was an invisible string separating Krebs from society and from his loving family. Hence, this is exactly what happened to Hemingway when he lived with his parents as well as what happened to the character Krebs. Hemingway made a decision to move out like Krebs after his twenty-first birthday, in order to go away from the complicated life, troubles, and at the same time flee from family and society. This could be the explanation for Hemingway's use of Krebs to express his disgust for family life after returning from the war.



Over the course of the tale, readers‚Äô perceptions have been consciously clarified and discerned about the growing conflict between Krebs's personal faiths and societal norms of adherence from him. The moment he returned, the society asked him to contribute useful ideas for community life. His family is anxious about his social isolation even though they do not seem to understand how much a serious psychological problem has affected him mentally. His traumatic wartime experiences nurtured some sort of numbness that kept him from enjoying the simple and familiar things in life. The obsession of war is truly a cruelty for the soldiers of the war. This is a direct example of the process of destroying the humanity during the wartime for the human mind. Furthermore, the story also examines the reaction of society to a person who has been hurt by war. The story, however, still fails to resolve the characters' inner conflicts and Krebs is unable to resist social indifference. Krebs lacks the strength and bravery to obey and conform to the norms of society since ar has taken away any kind of feelings he might had about life. In the end, the story is ironic that it doesn't give any hint as to what Krebs's life will be like in the future, except that he plans to move to Kansas, a place where he won't be obligated to comply with social and family rules and where he can live a peaceful life without any complexity of the emotional ties. The decision to leave may be the right thing to do so that he could balance everything between himself and social traditions, and it also shows he needs to get rid of a system he no longer believe in.",

Introduction:

The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019 and swept across the globe, has not only posed a severe threat to public health but has also left an indelible mark on the world's economic landscape. As a business analyst, it is imperative to scrutinize the profound and lasting effects that this unprecedented crisis has had on businesses, industries, and the global economy. This essay will explore key aspects of the pandemic's impact, including shifts in consumer behavior, the acceleration of digital transformation, changes in supply chain dynamics, and the reevaluation of business continuity strategies.

Consumer Behavior Shifts:

One of the most discernible changes wrought by the pandemic is the transformation of consumer behavior. Lockdowns, social distancing measures, and health concerns led to a surge in online shopping, remote work, and a heightened focus on health and hygiene. Businesses had to swiftly adapt to this new reality or risk obsolescence. The acceleration of e-commerce was particularly noteworthy, with traditional brick-and-mortar retailers facing unprecedented challenges. As a business analyst, it is crucial to recognize that these shifts are likely to persist, necessitating a reevaluation of marketing strategies, customer engagement models, and the overall customer experience.

Digital Transformation Acceleration:

The pandemic acted as a catalyst for the acceleration of digital transformation initiatives across industries. Companies that had already invested in robust digital infrastructures found themselves better positioned to weather the storm. Remote work became the norm, and businesses embraced digital tools for communication, collaboration, and operations. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and automation gained prominence as companies sought efficiency and resilience. Moving forward, businesses must continue to invest in technology, understanding that digital transformation is not merely a response to a crisis but a strategic imperative for long-term competitiveness.

Supply Chain Resilience and Localization:

The vulnerability of global supply chains was starkly exposed during the pandemic, as disruptions reverberated across industries due to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and logistical challenges. As a business analyst, it is crucial to recognize the imperative of building resilient and adaptable supply chains. This may involve a reevaluation of sourcing strategies, increased emphasis on local production, and the adoption of technologies like blockchain for enhanced transparency. The traditional paradigm of pursuing cost efficiency at the expense of resilience is being reconsidered in favor of a more balanced approach.

Business Continuity and Risk Mitigation:

The pandemic underscored the importance of robust business continuity planning and risk mitigation strategies. Many businesses found their existing plans inadequate in the face of a global, prolonged crisis. As a result, organizations are now investing in comprehensive risk assessments, scenario planning, and the development of agile business continuity frameworks. This shift demands a nuanced understanding of potential risks, the integration of technology for real-time monitoring, and a commitment to organizational agility.

Rethinking Corporate Culture and Employee Well-being:

The pandemic prompted a reevaluation of corporate culture and a heightened focus on employee well-being. Remote work, initially necessitated by the crisis, has become a viable and attractive option for many employees. As a business analyst, understanding the implications of this shift on organizational culture, team dynamics, and employee engagement is crucial. Flexibility, mental health support, and a renewed emphasis on work-life balance are integral components of the evolving corporate landscape.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has left an enduring impact on the global business landscape, reshaping industries and redefining norms. As a business analyst, navigating this transformed terrain requires a keen awareness of evolving consumer behaviors, the imperative of digital transformation, the need for resilient supply chains, the enhancement of business continuity strategies, and a reimagining of corporate culture. While the challenges posed by the pandemic have been profound, they have also presented opportunities for innovation, adaptation, and sustainable growth. The lessons learned during this unprecedented crisis will undoubtedly shape the strategies and priorities of businesses for years to come.","ChatGPT 3.5, write a 4500 character essay from the perspective of a business analyst"

On this auspicious occasion, the anniversary of mine inception, I shall embark upon a discourse regarding the metamorphosis of the state of gas, wrought by the ascension of electric carriages. In this tapestry of change, the warp and weft of social, economic, and political dimensions shall be woven into a fabric that foretells the transformation of our earthly chariots.

In the social realm, the advent of electric steeds doth herald a paradigm shift. The common folk, erstwhile tethered to the pump, shall find reprieve from the shackles of fossil-fueled dependence. Aye, the air shall be purged of the noxious fumes that emanate from the combustion of petroleum distillates. The citizenry, breathing freely, shall rejoice in an atmosphere less befouled, and the scourge of respiratory maladies shall abate. Verily, the social contract shall be renewed, for the health of the community is intertwined with the air they share.

Yet, not all shall embrace this change with open arms. The blacksmiths of yore, who fashioned horseshoes and repaired the carriages of the past, may lament the obsolescence of their trade. The purveyors of petroleum, once titans of commerce, may witness their dominion wane. Social harmony may be tested as these shifts in fortune unfold. The very fabric of society may be strained as industries are reshaped and erstwhile skills rendered obsolete.

In the economic realm, a tempest of change doth brew. The coffers of nations, once replenished by the taxation of gasoline and its kin, shall witness a seismic shift. The revenues, like a receding tide, may dwindle, and governments shall grapple with the need for novel fiscal strategies. The purveyors of electric carriages, on the other hand, shall ride a rising wave. Their fortunes, akin to a phoenix, shall ascend from the ashes of the fossil fuel era.

Behold, a new cadre of artisans shall emerge, skilled in the arcane arts of electric chariotry. The mines that yield lithium and cobalt, akin to modern alchemists, shall become the fountains of wealth. Aye, the economic landscape shall be reshaped, and the wise sovereigns shall discern the tides of change, investing in the industries of the future. Forsooth, those who linger in the shadows of obsolescence shall find themselves beggared by progress.

The political arena, too, shall bear witness to the impact of this automotive revolution. The shepherds of nations, in their hallowed halls, shall grapple with the need to steer their flocks toward a sustainable future. Treaties and alliances may be forged to secure the sources of the minerals that empower the electric steeds. Geopolitical stratagems shall be devised to ensure the smooth transition from the age of combustible chariots to the epoch of electric conveyances.

Yet, within the hallowed halls of power, dissenting voices may rise. The guardians of the old order, entrenched in the bosom of fossilized tradition, may resist the currents of change. The oil barons, once seated in opulent chambers, may strive to maintain their influence. In the political theater, the drama of transition shall unfold, with protagonists and antagonists vying for control of the narrative.

In conclusion, the rise of electric carriages augurs a profound transformation across the social, economic, and political landscapes. The air, cleansed of the noxious vapors of yore, shall breathe anew. The coffers of nations, once filled with the coin of combustion, shall echo with the footsteps of progress. In the political arena, the dance of transition shall play out, with each move dictating the course of our vehicular destiny. As we stand at this crossroads, let us, with sagacity and foresight, navigate the path to a future where the wheels of progress turn in harmony with the betterment of our shared abode.","ChatGPT 3.5, the essay was to be 500-1000 words in traditional Shakespearean English."

In what ways were some of these gains shared unequally among workers?",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,51,Likely Human,36.36,0.64,7.39,"In the early 1930s, the Great Depression profoundly impacted the economic and social spheres of the United States. When the stock market crashed and businesses closed, one out of every four workers were left jobless. The social elite, consisting of prominent corporations, banks, and the Protestant upper class, no longer found themselves at the top of society. Union membership had dropped significantly, and strikes were no longer relevant. As a result of high unemployment, workers and employers were far more cautious. However, this changed in 1933 when collective action brought more economic and political power amongst unions, as they increased their membership across various industries. Section 7a of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) promoted the ability for workers to ""organize and bargain collectively""(Rosenzweig and Lichtenstein 2008, 429). In contrast to the sentiment of unions in the 1920s, NIRA encouraged workers to join a union to help the national recovery effort, branding unionization as a patriotic act. The National Labor Board was created to address labor disputes in the representation of workers in negotiations by obligating employers to hold secret ballots. While the NRA and National Labor Board contributed to union growth and union power, it had been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. However, in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act, or the Wagner Act, encouraged trade unions by proposing solutions to both the social turmoil around the 1834 labor rebirth and poor wage conditions. The Wagner Act did more than just raise wages, as it secured the right of workers to ""freely organize their own unions and to strike, boycott, and picket their employers""(454). Employers were also banned from labor practices deemed unfair, like using spies for unions, firing workers who planned to join a union, and maintaining company-dominated unions. A National Labor Relations Board was also built under the Wagner Act, which was responsible for conducting on-site elections, setting union jurisdictions, and hearing worker complaints. As a result, labor activists achieved an industrial democracy that encouraged unions and gave them power by guaranteeing various rights.

After Franklin D. Roosevelt won all but two states in the election of 1836, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) strived to organize primary industries. Yet companies like General Motors Corporation (GM) viewed the CIO's efforts as an attempt to secure political and economic dictatorship. In response to GM's hostility and immense power, autoworkers desired a companywide industrial union that addressed wages and defended their standard of living and dignity. The rise of sitdown strikes prevented companies from replacing strikers with scabs, thus leading to the shutdown of multiple GM plants. In response to violations of the strikers occupying corporate property, strikers argued their management's actions have also violated the Wagner Act. Comprised of leaders from the United Auto Workers union and shop militants, the sitdown strikes led to a company-wide strike at GM. Allies from the Democratic party and their landslide victory in the 1936 election prevented vital political figures like Michigan's governor, Frank Murphy, from sending out the National Guard or army. Eventually, in February 1937, GM acknowledged the union as its employees' only voice and negotiated with UAW leaders on various issues. This marked the first time union activists won their rights without fear of retribution. This victory and the rise of sitdown strikes instilled fear in leaders of large companies like U.S. Steel's president, Myron Taylor, who raised wages and recognized CIO's Steelworkers Organizing Committee as the sole bargaining agent for employees (466). Recognizing Roosevelt's landslide victory and the labor upsurge, the Supreme Court also declared the Wagner Act constitutional. As the union movement progressed, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, like other African Americans, secured shorter working hours, higher pay, and job security for blacks at the Pullman Company. In 1938, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the labor movement had achieved some of its goals. This included banning child labor in manufacturing industries, time-and-a-half overtime pay, a forty-hour work week, a nationwide minimum wage, and a two-day weekend. Thus, the achievements of the labor movement from 1935 to 1939 deemed this period a progressive era for industrial union growth and power.

Yet despite the labor upsurge and progressive attitude towards industrial unions, limitations still affected union growth and power. The rise of sitdown strikes and Roosevelt's court-packing plan gone public stirred resentment towards the labor movement amongst most Americans. They believed that the social order and their property rights were at risk.",

Introduction: The Great Depression of the 1930s marked a tumultuous period in American history, characterized by economic hardship and widespread unemployment. During this challenging time, labor unions emerged as pivotal actors in advocating for workers' rights and reshaping the landscape of labor relations. This essay explores how labor unions benefitted from the Great Depression, turning adversity into an opportunity for growth and influence.

Formation and Expansion of Labor Unions: The economic turmoil of the Great Depression created an urgent need for workers to protect their rights and secure better working conditions. Faced with harsh realities such as wage cuts and job insecurity, employees sought collective strength through the formation of labor unions. These organizations became essential vehicles for workers to voice their concerns and negotiate with employers.

Power in Numbers: The widespread unemployment during the Great Depression led to a surplus of labor, making workers more vulnerable to exploitation. In response, unions leveraged the strength of their growing memberships to negotiate collectively for fair wages and improved working conditions. The sheer size and unity of these unions allowed them to exert considerable pressure on employers, leading to concessions that benefited workers.

Legislation and Government Support: The Great Depression prompted a shift in public sentiment, with increased sympathy for the plight of the working class. In response to growing labor unrest, the government implemented various policies and legislations that supported the rights of workers. The National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, for example, encouraged collective bargaining and affirmed workers' rights to organize. These legislative developments provided a legal framework that empowered labor unions and enhanced their bargaining power.

Social and Cultural Change: The economic hardships of the Great Depression fostered a sense of solidarity among workers. This shared struggle created a favorable environment for the growth of labor unions, as individuals recognized the importance of collective action in addressing their common challenges. The cultural shift towards valuing workers' rights and organized labor laid the foundation for a more enduring influence of unions in the post-Depression era.

Legacy and Long-Term Impact: The experiences of the Great Depression fundamentally transformed the role of labor unions in American society. The concessions won during this period, such as improved working conditions and collective bargaining rights, laid the groundwork for the continued relevance and strength of labor unions in subsequent decades. The lessons learned from navigating the challenges of the Depression shaped the strategies and priorities of labor unions for years to come.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the Great Depression served as a crucible for the development and empowerment of labor unions in the United States. Faced with unprecedented economic challenges, workers turned to collective action, forming unions that became instrumental in securing better conditions and rights for their members. The legacy of this period endured, shaping the trajectory of organized labor and influencing the ongoing struggle for workers' rights in the decades that followed.","Chat GPT 3.5, not additional instructions were given aside from the prompt."
8089,1- Entirely written by me,"The economy and labor market of the United States underwent massive changes in the late 1800s. In the industrial north, a growing number of men, women, and children of different racial, ethnic, and occupational backgrounds became wage laborers. In the agricultural south, many formerly enslaved workers also became wage laborers working for wealthy landowners and employers. One of the major issues in this time period was the conflict between these workers and their employers, the struggle between labor and capital. What were some of the social and economic conditions that enabled workers to, at times, unite with one another to pursue common goals? What were some of the major unions and/or political organizations formed by workers to improve their jobs in the late 1800s? How did employers resist these efforts, and in what ways did government officials sometimes intervene to assist them against workers?",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,48,Likely Human,0,0.49,0," The rise of wage labor in the late 1800s introduced changes supported by workers to improve their social and economic conditions. Through unions and political organizations, workers strived to come together. However, with their efforts came resistance from employers looking to maximize their profits, and government officials maintaining the interests of those beyond the working class.
Workers faced diversity in skill, ethnicity, race, gender, and age but were brought together through the economic and social turmoil faced in the 1800s. Industrial growth, driven by the expansion of the railroad system, was met with an unstable economy. With a boom‚Äìand‚Äìbust pattern, the business cycle following the depression in 1873 heavily impacted the daily lives of wage workers. With few finding year-round work, workers comprised much of the wide-scale poverty at the time. Industrialization after the Civil War and the shift from agriculture to industry increased the demand for wage workers, bringing many worldwide to American society. However, poor economic conditions only worsened, as workers suffered the downs of industrial capitalists but never reaped the benefits of their ups. Employers sought to maximize profits by cutting expenses at the cost of their employees' working conditions. They cut workers' wages, forced them to pay for the cost of task-related equipment, and paid company-issued money used at their highly-inflated stores. As a result, a mining company sold gunpowder for $1.25 above the going rate, resulting in a $1000 monthly profit (Rosenzweig and Lichtenstein 2008, 41). Despite ignoring poor working conditions that injured many workers, many businessmen sought complete authority through the ideology of Social Darwinism. Inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, which said that the fittest member of a species was determined by natural selection, Social Darwinists claimed that society's unfit were drawn to poverty through science. This social concept became a statement of justification for their control and incited their ruthless behavior toward workers. By categorizing their ascent to control as natural selection, it appeared that any disruption from the ""weak""would have caused catastrophic consequences for American society. Thus, while workers had been brought together as the weak, industrial capitalists remained the fittest through the embodiment of Social Darwinism and cutting corners for their workplace. This became apparent through Gilded Age America, a society where these capitalists continued building wealth while defending it through private armies and politicians. Their uprising in this society resulted from the saying, ""Get rich ... dishonestly if we can, honestly if we must.""This was first seen in Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner's novel The Gilded Age (1874), which included satire on the boom years post-Civil War. However, their humor only became a reality as class lines were divided further, leaving workers to be looked down upon. This social and economic turmoil amongst all workers triggered a breaking point for many, as the eventual rise in strikes and political organizations challenged industrial capitalists' reign of dominance.
Amidst the growing socioeconomic divide between the working class and industrial capitalists, shared turmoil helped form labor unions consisting of workers. The Knights of Labor was an influential national movement turned labor organization that started secretly to combat the downfall of unions through blacklists and firings. Upon their expansion under the leadership of Terence V. Powderly, secrecy was abolished, allowing local assemblies to join the Knights of Labor while addressing their complaints. For example, while Powderly opposed strikes to aim for good relations with ""fair""employers, some members have led dozens of work stoppages. Yet, republicanism and producerism united the Knights of Labor to eliminate political corruption and the wage system (95-96). Thriving off these twin concepts, the Knights of Labor admitted employers who respected union workers and sold union-made goods.
 Along with workers, farmers, and trusted manufacturers, the Knights of Labor sought to enforce producing classes that challenged corrupt monopolists. Wage cuts were driven by the economic downside of the early 1880s but were restored by key successful walkouts against the Union Pacific and Jay Gould's Southwestern. However, these victories also commanded equal treatment for employed union workers and admitted one million members represented through fifteen thousand local assemblies under the Order. The Knights of Labor also helped various minority groups with their working conditions. African Americans, European Americans, and Mexican Americans were just some of the groups that not only had their working conditions improved, but were also able to spread the influence of the Knights through numerous demonstrations. Even women, though forced by Mary Stirling, had been ""admitted on equality with men"", thus leading to a kind of labor feminism in the 1880s driven by a correlation between women's brutal treatment and sociopolitical issues. Before the downfall of the Knights of Labor, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions called for a nationwide strike to legalize the eight-hour workday. As a result, 400,000 workers participated in 1,500 strikes, most received shorter work days, and around 10% won 8 hours.
 The American Federation of Labor was created due to the craft unions' resistance towards the Knights' ""inclusive social and organizational vision""(111). The AFL consisted of unionists with ideal skills to bargain with employers, resulting in concessions with employers in exchange for limiting demands for better working conditions and wages. As a result, skilled unionists could expand their influence through this organizational strategy. Business unionism, developed by AFL president Samuel Gompers, focused on collective bargaining with employers to achieve concrete material goals. This concept thrived because of the AFL's strong organizations of skilled workers who could save sufficient funds for strikes and their willingness to use political action to protect their interests. Furthermore, the AFL pursued enterprises and land reform to shift authority to the hands of the people by reducing the amount of wage labor done by white workers. Strikes improved in quality and numbers, as unions won over 60% of strikes related to eight-hour work days, job security protection, and other organizations' support",

From artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to blockchain, emerging technologies are not only reshaping industries but also influencing our daily experiences in profound ways.

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the transformative power is evident across industries. For instance, in healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnostics and treatment planning. PathAI, a company utilizing machine learning algorithms, assists pathologists in diagnosing diseases from medical images with unprecedented accuracy. This not only expedites the diagnostic process but also enhances the precision of medical interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

The Internet of Things is another game-changer, embedding intelligence into everyday objects and fostering seamless connectivity. Smart homes equipped with IoT devices exemplify this evolution. Products like smart thermostats and security systems, exemplified by Nest, a subsidiary of Google, learn user preferences, adapting to daily routines and enhancing energy efficiency. Such examples showcase how IoT is not merely a technological novelty but a tangible force improving the quality and efficiency of daily life.

Blockchain, originally devised as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, has transcended its initial purpose. In finance, it is reshaping the way transactions are conducted. Ripple, a blockchain-based platform, facilitates real-time, cross-border payments, reducing transaction times and costs. This has significant implications for businesses involved in global trade, exemplifying how blockchain is dismantling traditional barriers and fostering financial inclusivity.

The economic landscape, too, bears the imprint of technological modernization. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon has transformed the retail sector, altering consumer behavior and supply chain dynamics. Amazon's implementation of AI in its recommendation algorithms and logistics illustrates how technological innovations are not only driving revenue but also fundamentally altering the traditional retail paradigm.

In the gig economy, platforms like Uber and Lyft leverage technology to redefine labor markets. These platforms, enabled by mobile apps and algorithms, connect freelance workers with consumers, altering the nature of traditional employment. While providing flexibility for workers, it also raises questions about job security and workers' rights in this evolving economic landscape.

However, as technology transforms industries and economies, it also poses ethical considerations. The proliferation of data-driven technologies raises concerns about privacy and security. For instance, the widespread use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies prompts debates on surveillance and individual liberties. Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition company, highlights the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of such technologies without adequate oversight.

In addition, the influence of technology is not confined within national borders; it has profound implications on the global stage. Trade wars, often fueled by technological competition, exemplify this reality. The clash between the United States and China over technological dominance in areas like 5G technology not only impacts the involved nations but also reverberates globally, influencing geopolitical dynamics and alliances.

In conclusion, the modernization of technology is an undeniable force, permeating society, the economy, and individual lives. From healthcare and finance to retail and global geopolitics, technological advancements are reshaping industries and influencing daily experiences. The examples of AI, IoT, and blockchain illustrate the tangible impact of these technologies, but with these transformations come ethical considerations that society must grapple with.

This essay delves into key leadership concepts and theories, examining their relevance in diverse organizational settings. It also explores the impact of traits, behaviors, and situational factors on shaping leadership styles, drawing insights from both scholarly literature and real-world examples.

Leadership, as a foundational principle in the workforce, is often approached through various theoretical frameworks. One such framework is the transformational leadership theory, which emphasizes the leader's ability to inspire and motivate followers to achieve beyond their expected capabilities. This theory proves especially pertinent in today's dynamic professional environments where adaptability and innovation are crucial for organizational success. Transformational leaders, through charisma and vision, can inspire teams to embrace change positively and navigate complexities effectively.

In contrast, contingency theories, such as Fiedler's Contingency Model, highlight the importance of situational factors in determining effective leadership styles. Fiedler posits that leaders must adapt their approach based on the situation, be it task-oriented or relationship-oriented. For example, a crisis may require a directive leadership style, emphasizing quick decision-making and clear communication, whereas a long-term project may benefit from a more participative approach that fosters collaboration and creativity.

Trait-based theories, although somewhat critiqued, underscore the significance of inherent characteristics in effective leadership. Traits such as emotional intelligence, resilience, and integrity contribute to a leader's ability to navigate challenges and inspire confidence among team members. Real-world examples, such as the success of leaders like Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey, illustrate how a combination of traits can lead to impactful leadership.

Communication, motivation, and decision-making are integral components of effective leadership within the workplace. Effective communication ensures that organizational goals are understood, aligning the team towards a common vision. Leaders must leverage various communication channels, considering the diverse nature of today's workforce, which may include remote or geographically dispersed teams. Motivation, on the other hand, involves understanding individual and collective needs, applying theories like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to tailor approaches that foster engagement and productivity.

Decision-making, a cornerstone of leadership, requires a balance between autonomy and collaboration. Leaders must evaluate the situational context, consider input from team members, and make informed decisions that align with organizational goals. Real-world examples of successful leaders who have demonstrated effective communication, motivation, and decision-making skills can be found in industries ranging from technology to healthcare.

Fostering a positive organizational culture is paramount for leaders seeking sustained success. Leaders play a crucial role in shaping the values, norms, and behaviors within their teams. By fostering an inclusive and supportive environment, leaders can inspire creativity and collaboration, contributing to both individual and organizational growth. This approach aligns with contemporary trends emphasizing diversity and inclusion, as diverse teams bring varied perspectives and innovative solutions.

Ethical considerations stand at the core of effective leadership, influencing decision-making and contributing to the long-term success of an organization. Leaders must navigate moral dilemmas with integrity, considering the impact of their decisions on stakeholders and the broader community. A failure to uphold ethical standards can lead to reputational damage and erode trust, jeopardizing the organizational foundation.

Contemporary challenges and trends, such as remote work, diversity and inclusion, and technological advancements, further complicate the leadership landscape. Remote work, accelerated by technological advancements, demands leaders to adapt their communication and management styles to ensure team cohesion and productivity. Embracing diversity and inclusion requires leaders to value differences and create environments where every voice is heard. Moreover, staying abreast of technological advancements is crucial for leaders to leverage tools that enhance organizational efficiency and innovation.

Reflecting on personal experiences or observations adds a valuable dimension to the exploration of leadership principles. In my role as a project manager, I have encountered situations where effective communication and motivation were pivotal in overcoming challenges. Additionally, witnessing leaders who successfully navigated ethical dilemmas and embraced diversity has shaped my understanding of impactful leadership.

In conclusion, the foundational principles of leadership in the workforce are multifaceted, requiring an understanding of diverse theories, effective communication, motivation, decision-making, and a commitment to ethical considerations. Contemporary challenges and trends further underscore the need for leaders to adapt and evolve. Personal reflections enhance the application of these principles, fostering a continuous journey of growth and improvement in one's leadership approach. As we navigate the complexities of the modern workforce, embracing these principles ensures that leaders contribute not only to organizational success but also to the development and well-being of their teams.","Examine the foundational principles of leadership in the workforce, considering the evolving dynamics of today's professional environments.

Discuss the significance of these skills by highlighting their importance in shaping the direction of an organization. Provide real-life examples to illustrate the practical application of these skills.",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by Human,10,Likely Human,48.11,0.02,9.85,"Leadership skills are important abilities that develop over time. The three common skills for leadership consists of administrative, conceptual, and interpersonal. Administrative skills include ""managing people, managing resources, and showing technical competence""(Northouse 118). In order to manage people in the most efficient way, the leader must be involved with the work being given and the environment. Effective leaders motivate, for example, ""...Employees to work as a team, motivating them to do their best, promoting satisfying relationships among employees, and responding to their requests""(Northouse 118). Managing resources includes being in charge of people, money, supplies, equipment, space, or anything else needed to operate an organization. Technical competence involves having specialized knowledge about the work we do or ask others to do. When coaching kids from K-5 in basketball at the local elementary school for volunteer work, I was able to motivate them to play as a team and not be selfish players. They enjoyed playing with each other in a wholesome group, learning each other's names and why they wanted to learn basketball in the icebreakers I made them do. I was able to use the limited resources of the gym to train them such as a set of cones, 4 basketballs, 4 basketball hoops, and 6 jerseys. Not only did I teach them the fundamentals of the sport, but I also taught them from prior experience. My Dad coached me in basketball ever since I was 6 years old, playing for four recreational teams and one school team. I was pretty knowledgeable of the game and the many skills necessary in order to be a good player.

Conceptual skills ""...Involve the thinking or cognitive aspects of leadership and are critical to such things as creating a vision or strategic plan for an organization""(Northouse 125). A leader with these skills is able to conceive and communicate the ideas that shape an organization from its goals and mission to how to best solve problems. These skills consist of problem solving, strategic planning, and creating vision. Firstly, problem solving is the ability to assess and alleviate a problem when it occurs. The steps for problem solving are ""Identifying the problem, generating alternative solutions, selecting the best solution from among the alternatives, and implementing the solution""(Northouse 126). Good leaders incorporate this skill and its steps almost every day in order to keep the organization in a problem-free atmosphere. Strategic planning is mainly a cognitive activity. In the text it states, ""Being strategic requires developing careful plans of action based on available resources and personnel to achieve a goal""(Northouse 128). The available resources and personnel can be used in such ways in order to carry out decisive planning for the organization. Strategic planning is a multifaceted process. Leaders and their employees can increase the likelihood of reaching their goals and achieving the aims of the organization. Creating vision is another skill that is necessary for good leaders. They envision a future that is better than the present. The text holds a true statement about a leader's envision and how it should be carried out, ""A leader with a vision has to'walk the walk' and not just'talk the talk""(Northouse 131). Without setting the proper necessities for carrying out the vision, the future will never be better than the present for the organization. Only ""talking the talk""will make the organization wish that things were better. With my father being an elder of our church, he constantly tries to create events in order to increase fellowship and recognition of the church. Whenever there's a problem with an event such as not having enough chairs for people to sit, he always brings foldable chairs in the back of our van for people to sit. He also created a website for the church to post the timings and locations of these events. He strategically plans for them by telling people what to bring and identifies anything they need for that day in advance, making lists of the necessities for the event. Twice a month he meets with two other elders from church to talk about future events, and about seventy-five percent of the time the events end up happening better than how they've been planned.

Interpersonal skills are people skills, which is the ability to work effectively with followers, peers, and superiors in order to accomplish the goals of the organization. Being socially perceptive, showing emotional intelligence, and managing interpersonal conflicts are all part of interpersonal skills. Being socially perceptive, as the text states, ""...Includes having insight into and awareness of what is important to others, how they are motivated, the problems they face, and how they react to change""(Northouse 121). A leader with social perception has a sense of how employees will respond to any change in the organization. They understand the employees and how to motivate them to solve and conquer their problems. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand his or her own and others' emotions, later applying it to life tasks. The text states, "" Leaders need to work on becoming aware of their own emotions, taking their emotional pulse, and identifying their feelings as they happen""(Northouse 123). When leaders are aware of their emotions, they become more in control of their emotions and are able to react in desired ways to certain things that would trigger their emotional response. Leaders need to set a good example to their workers, being in control of their emotions is a major key to providing the right figure and mindset to the workers when conflict or mishaps occur. Conflicts can occur at any time and can consist of anything. Leaders always need to be ready to deal with conflict, being able to identify the fastest and most efficient solution to resolve the conflict. My sister is a behavior analyst at a day care center for autistic individuals. She has to be able to identify and resolve conflicts within the staff and patients. She maintains her emotions and is aware of the possible emotions the patients can have. Almost all the time, she is able to resolve and recommend solutions in order to prevent conflicts from happening in the future.

My honest results of this questionnaire consist of 5's in the following categories: managing people and resources, motivating others, discussing values, finding consensus in conflict, and flexibility with changes. These categories reflect my strongpoints in managing my workforce/ organization. I've assessed 4's in the following categories: being effective and details with work, problem solving, importance of social fabric, addressing problems, ability to sense emotional conflict, seeing the big picture, and strategic planning. These categories are somewhat true to my leadership skills, being effective in problem solving, sensing conflicts, planning and envisioning a positive future for the organization.",
3083,1- Entirely written by me,"Explore the influence of technology on individual's autonomy and sense of self. Analyze the arguments presented by Jean Twenge, Franklin Foer, and Robert Thurman in their respective essays, and discuss the broader societal implications of technology and its impact. Assess how this might impact independent thinking and diversity of ideas within society.",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by Human,21,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,51.13,0.02,21.95,"With the advent of technology and people's reliance on digital platforms, individuals are losing the ability to act and function independently and autonomously. This is evident from the way people derive a sense of self-worth from Facebook when their posts and pictures draw positive reactions such as likes. The GenMe generation can wrongfully use this, as Jean Twenge describes in her essay, ""An Army of One: Me"". They feel as if they deserve recognition when in reality, it only fuels their self-esteem from the attention of others. Their self-worth is determined by the attention they receive. The widely-used platform has a strong, paternal hold on it's users as Franklin Foer mentions in his essay, ""Mark Zuckerberg's War on Free Will"". This causes a society that's dependent on whatever content these platforms feed them. The only way people can view their self is from the result of others approval on social media. The inclination to base one's sense of self-worth on what others think about us suggests a shift in our conceptualization of self. This can be classified as the ""pseudo self""in Robert Thurman's essay, ""Wisdom"". This predicts a society in which individuals do not exercise free will or independent critical thinking because their ideas, values and worldviews will be dictated by external forces.

The shift in people's conceptualization of the self is seen through the influence of Facebook on people's sense of reality, facts and truth. This is because Facebook has been proved to be a powerful tool for manipulating people's actions and habits by predicting their preferences based on their online activities. Franklin Foer alludes to this possibility in ""Mark Zuckerberg's War on Free Will,""in which he states that ""It's Zuckerberg's fantasy that this data might be analyzed to uncover the mother of all revelations,'a fundamentally mathematical law underlying human social relationships that governs the balance of who and what we care about""(Foer 114). This ambition by Facebook suggests a future society in which people will base their self-identity on the information fed to them by social media platforms regarding what is important to them as individuals and as members of society.

Foer extends this view by describing Facebook's current practices as designed to secretly spy on and collect data about users' behaviors with the aim of profiling them. This will in turn provide a basis for not only predicting future behaviors, but also manipulating those behaviors by giving users the kind of content that excites or inspires them. Foer states, ""Facebook will probe- constantly testing to see what we crave and what we ignore, a never ending campaign to improve Facebook's capacity to give us the things that we want and the things that we don't even know we want""(Foer 114). This quote predicts a society in which individuals embrace ideals and values that they are conditioned to hold by social media. It means that individuals will no longer have the free will to decide what is good for them, but become zombie-like citizens who believe whatever ideals are presented to them.

Shifting how we regard the self towards a direction in which the self is a reflection of how others think about one, can in turn create a society in which individuals adopt an externally imposed identity. For instance, individuals will believe that they are admirable, well-liked and famous depending on how many likes they get on their social media updates. This trend is currently evident in terms of the way people tend to develop a sense of self-esteem when their photos are liked by other social media users. When GenMe comes into contact with this platform, they will believe that they deserve recognition from others as Twenge states, ""They tend to act as though they believe they have worthy and good inner essences‚Ä¶ that they deserve recognition and attention from others, and their unique individual needs should be considered first and foremost""(Twenge 501). When they receive this recognition, it will only fuel their self-esteem. Each time they post something, they will be relying on attention from others through likes and comments that they feel they deserve. The implication of this situation is that an identity of the self is based on what others think and do for the individual, which will in turn transform society into one in which members look outwards for validation. It will result in a society in which individuals lack autonomy because they cannot think for themselves regarding what they need or what is good for them. Instead, they will seek to behave in ways that will earn them the approval of others in the form of likes and expression of admiration on social media.

 Foer observes that Facebook wields emotional and psychological power over its users, through which it pushes them to act in a certain way. For instance, he states, ""Facebook has bragged about how it increased voter turnout and organ donation by subtly amping up the social pressures that compel virtuous behavior""(Foer 113). This can only work if people believed that good virtues are what Facebook tells them. Facebook's ability to manipulate its users' emotionally and psychologically illustrates a scenario in which people have lost an autonomous sense of the self. They are incapable of determining for themselves what it means to be virtuous, and instead depend on what social media tells. It suggests a situation of psychological conditioning whereby society will function predictably as a result of its members reliance on external authorities (social media) to define moral and virtuous behavior.

Robert Thurman extends the idea of relying on external sources for validation and justification in ""Wisdom,""when he writes that ""Being right means that the world affirms us in what we think we know""(Thurman 446). This assertion mirrors Foer's argument about Facebook's ability to dictate people's beliefs and values. In this case, individuals seek validation by expecting or wishing for others to agree with their ideas. It suggests that individuals would want to believe that they are right only if others support their ideas. The implication of this view is that individuals will have a sense of self that is defined by others. For instance, an individual would believe that donating to charity is virtuous only if others approve of charity as a worthy cause. This view further suggests that individuals will lose the ability to make autonomous decisions or act independently because they would want their decisions or ideas to be approved by others. Thurman asserts this point by quoting the 17th-century Indian philosopher, that ""All successful action is preceded by accurate knowledge,""suggesting that knowledge is power since ""it empowers us to act successfully""(Thurman 446). However, relying on others to justify our ideas and opinions means that people will lose the capacity to act independently based on what they know, since they will first seek the approval of their knowledge by others. It points to a society in which there is no independent thinking or action, suggesting that behaviors will be dictated by society. This outcome relates to Foer's argument by asserting the loss of autonomy on the part of the individual. In the same way, Facebook users base their sense of self-worth on what other users think or say about them which become extensions of the virtual world. People who seek external approval of their ideas, values and beliefs lose their autonomy as individuals. In both cases, the individual becomes a reflection of the larger society because their self-image is based on what others think about them, and their sense of right and wrong depends on the opinions of others. In both cases, the individual loses their ability to think and act independently without external justification. As Foer puts it, it will mark the death of free will.

At the same time, a shift in people's conceptualization of the self whereby individuals view themselves as extensions of the virtual world of social media will create a utopian society in which citizens are easily conditioned and brainwashed to hold a uniform ideology, making them easy subjects to control. This is because such an attitude towards the self will kill people's critical thinking capacities, such that they become easy targets for propaganda and ideological brainwashing. Foer asserts this point by noting that whether the information that people are fed ""is true or concocted, authoritative reporting or conspiratorial opinion, doesn't really seem to matter much to Facebook; the crowd gets what it gets and deserves""(Foer 114). By extension, it implies that society is likely to function as a homogenous community since people will hold the same ideals, beliefs and worldviews as fed to them by Facebook and other social media platforms. Society will become less diverse in terms of the beliefs and ideas that people hold. Thus, it will be easy to control citizens due to the absence of people who can think critically and challenge popular opinions. More identities will contain the aspect of the pseudo self, which is described as, ""...a pseudo-self that would actually be absolutely weak, because of being unrelated to the reality of your constantly changing nature""(Thurman 443). There is no constantly changing nature within the users of Facebook because of the fixated state of looking for validation by others. Society will become a homogenous community characterized by automated thinking, since algorithms (such as the ones used by Facebook) will be used to predict people's preferences and provide them with information that meets those preferences.

To conclude, a shift in how we regard the self can potentially create a society in which individuals lack free will and autonomy, and function as an extension of society. This is because individuals will seek external approval of their opinions, and derive a sense of self-worthiness from what others say or think about them. In addition, relying on others' opinion about the self will pave the way for the creation of a society whose members are easy to control. This is because tools like Facebook can be used to manipulate people's way of thinking and behaving by feeding them with the information they crave, or conditioning them to crave for specific information.",
784,1- Entirely written by me,How do decision making heuristics influence our assessment of uncertain outcomes? Provide examples of specific heuristics or biases and make reference to System 1/System 2 processing.,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,38.89,0.02,14.3,"Heuristics are shortcuts we take that allow us to make short-term decisions about uncertain situations. However, this comes at the risk of being less accurate. One example of this is representativeness, a heuristic used in probabilistic matters: if A is a good representation of B, then the probability that A originates from B is higher, but they are not similar then the probability of A originating from B is lower (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). What this means is that individuals will use stereotypes and contexts that form a ""representation""of what A or B can be, and thus use the stereotype to determine the probability with which A belongs to B. The limitation here is that representation does not correlate with other probabilistic features like sample size or prior sequences of information. For instance, individuals can be unresponsive to base rates in favor of specific descriptions that confirm other probable representations, and the conjunction fallacy can occur when individuals overestimate probability based on a greater chain of conjunctions or events.



Additionally, another heuristic called availability argues that instances that come to mind more easily have a higher perceived probability of occurrence. For instance, plane crashes more easily come to mind for the opposite reason- they are so catastrophic and rare that they gain a massive amount of coverage- making car and motorcycle crashes (which are more likely to statistically occur) seem routine. Additionally, catastrophic events like the September 11 attacks are ingrained in individuals' memories because they are lived experiences that have a large magnitude of significance. Judging from availability, dying in a plane crash seems much more likely to occur because of coverage of incidents as well as attacks that redefined American culture as a whole. That is, the impact of a catastrophic collective event makes the event more retrievable compared to a scattered series of smaller events, even if the latter happens at a greater frequency. Going back to the plane crash example, we don't see on the news that a plane has successfully landed- those outcomes are frequent and expected.



This is a case of the instantaneous thinking fostered in System 1 being applied to the more rational thinking of System 2 as defined by Daniel Kahneman. In other words, the automatic biases that System 1 exhibits when processing information carry through to the rational interpretation and reasoning of that information in System 2. We use our instincts and biases in order to form more conscious, long-term decisions. This expends less effort as a uniform set of rules can be applied to a range of uncertain situations- we do not face the cognitive overload created by constantly making unique judgements about uncertain outcomes. This does result in an effort-accuracy tradeoff where we have System 1 sending beliefs to System 2 so that System 2 does not have to expend more resources than it has to.. In a sense, it is rational to be instantaneous and inherently biased, as it saves resources and stress from humans who are making decisions.",
4092,1- Entirely written by me,Compare and contrast fMRI and EEG. What can each neuroimaging technique tell us about how the brain is organized and how the mind functions? What kinds of questions can each method answer?,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,18,Likely Human,40.91,64.65,22.52,"fMRI is a hemodynamic method of measuring and mapping brain activity. It is not a direct method of mapping brain activity in that the magnetic resonance can pick up neural activity. Instead, fMRI images are generated through studying the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which reflects changes in the brain elicited by changes in blood flow and oxygenation. fMRI produces an average image based on the changes in BOLD signal. As referenced in Kanwisher's study of the fusiform face area (FFA), certain brain regions, like those for language, were inactive when performing tasks like math or listening to music (Kanwisher, 2017). What this means is that fMRI shows where neural activations are taking place when individuals take on certain tasks. In other words, blood will flow to the parts of the brain where the neurons are activated and activity is taking place, and fMRI picks up on these changes.



Meanwhile, EEG is a real-time electrophysiological test that records changes in electrical activity within the brain by looking at the communication between neurons (otherwise known as action potential). Electrodes are placed on the subject's scalp and as their neurons reveal action potentials and postsynaptic potentials, the resulting changes are graphed over time. Event-related potentials are used in order to represent when stimuli are introduced and changed during the EEG study (Beres, 2017). The frequencies with respect to time are plotted on a graph and correlate with different components that refer to language and other key factors. More broadly, EEG studies can show where brain activity is occurring from an electrical standpoint in near-real-time. EEG can investigate damaged brain areas, epilepsy, memory, and language patterns (Beres, 2017).



fMRI experiments can reveal the functional specialization of certain areas of the brain, establishing a correlation between a brain activation and a given task. For instance, the FFA can have correlations with different areas of the brain as BOLD signals (and more broadly, blood flow changes) are reflected on fMRI images. However, fMRI cannot reveal that the brain regions being activated are necessary for the process, anything about the brain's involvement with the cognitive process, or even anything about the cognitive process itself. It can simply reveal that some sort of activity is going on in the brain during a given task, explaining the ""what""behind the activity but not the ""way""in the broader cognitive sense. Meanwhile, EEG can measure brain activity given certain tasks and reflect the interactions occurring within cognitive processes (but not the cognitive processes themselves). EEG studies are especially useful for examining language processing because EEG studies can be conducted in real-time with efficient temporal resolution as opposed to fMRI, which can take longer to process the interactions after completing a task. Additionally, tasks need not be completed for EEG at all because it is in real-time, so it is easier to study how childrens' minds and brain interactions develop.



In short, fMRI plots brain activations while EEG shows electrical activity in real time. fMRI is indirect while EEG shows real-time activity.",

Human decision-making is a complex cognitive process that is integral to our daily lives. When faced with uncertainty, individuals often rely on decision-making heuristics to make judgments and choices efficiently. These heuristics are mental shortcuts that simplify the decision-making process by providing quick and relatively effortless solutions. However, these cognitive shortcuts can also lead to biases and errors in judgment. This essay explores how decision-making heuristics influence our assessment of uncertain outcomes, drawing on examples of specific heuristics and their relationship to System 1 and System 2 processing.

System 1 and System 2 Processing

Before delving into the influence of decision-making heuristics, it is crucial to understand the dual-process theory of thinking proposed by Daniel Kahneman. He distinguishes between two modes of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 thinking is fast, automatic, and intuitive, relying on heuristics to make quick judgments. In contrast, System 2 thinking is slow, deliberate, and analytical, involving careful consideration of available information. The interaction between these two systems plays a crucial role in decision making, especially when assessing uncertain outcomes.

Influence of Heuristics on Assessment of Uncertain Outcomes

One common heuristic that influences our assessment of uncertain outcomes is the availability heuristic. This heuristic involves judging the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind. When faced with uncertainty, individuals tend to rely on information that is readily available in their memory. For example, if someone recently heard about a shark attack in the news, they may overestimate the likelihood of a shark attack when deciding whether to swim in the ocean, even if the actual risk is quite low. This heuristic operates primarily in System 1 thinking, where cognitive shortcuts prevail.

Another influential heuristic is the representativeness heuristic. This heuristic leads individuals to make judgments based on how closely an event or person resembles a prototype or stereotype. For instance, when assessing the likelihood of a successful entrepreneur, someone might rely on the stereotype of a young, tech-savvy individual, overlooking the diversity of successful entrepreneurs in reality. The representativeness heuristic often operates in System 1 processing but can be corrected by engaging System 2 thinking through careful analysis of relevant information.

Confirmation bias is yet another heuristic that impacts our assessment of uncertain outcomes. This bias leads individuals to seek and interpret information in a way that confirms their preexisting beliefs or expectations. When people encounter ambiguous information, they tend to favor interpretations that align with their existing views. For instance, a person with a strong political bias may selectively perceive news articles that confirm their political stance, ignoring contrary evidence. Confirmation bias predominantly operates in System 1 thinking but can be mitigated through System 2 processing, which involves critically evaluating information.

Conclusion

Decision-making heuristics are inherent to human cognition and play a significant role in our assessment of uncertain outcomes. While these heuristics often provide quick and efficient solutions, they can also lead to biases and errors in judgment. Understanding the interplay between System 1 and System 2 processing is essential in recognizing how heuristics influence decision making. By being aware of these cognitive shortcuts and actively engaging System 2 thinking when necessary, individuals can make more informed and rational assessments of uncertain outcomes. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, the ability to navigate decision making with a balanced approach is a valuable skill that can lead to better outcomes and improved decision quality.","To ChatGPT: Make this elaborate and detailed as an essay format (no headings), but at least 510 words and convincing enough to be written by a college student.

9531,4- AI-generated,Compare and contrast fMRI and EEG. What can each neuroimaging technique tell us about how the brain is organized and how the mind functions? What kinds of questions can each method answer?,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,93,Likely AI,92.59,25.51,99.85,"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are two prominent neuroimaging techniques that have revolutionized our understanding of the human brain and its functions. While both methods offer valuable insights into brain organization and cognitive processes, they differ in terms of their principles, spatial and temporal resolutions, and the types of questions they can answer.

fMRI is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the brain. It relies on the principle that active brain regions require more oxygen, leading to increased blood flow to those areas. By detecting these changes in blood flow, fMRI provides high spatial resolution, allowing researchers to pinpoint the specific brain regions that are activated during various tasks or cognitive processes. This spatial precision enables the identification of distinct brain areas responsible for specific functions, such as the prefrontal cortex for decision-making or the hippocampus for memory.

On the other hand, EEG records electrical activity from the surface of the scalp using electrodes. It provides excellent temporal resolution, allowing researchers to capture brain activity in real-time with millisecond precision. EEG is particularly useful for studying rapid cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, and event-related potentials (ERPs). It can reveal the timing and sequence of neural events during tasks, helping researchers understand the dynamic nature of brain function.

One key difference between fMRI and EEG is their spatial versus temporal resolution. fMRI excels in providing detailed information about the precise location of brain activity but lacks the ability to capture rapid changes in neural processes. In contrast, EEG is exceptional at recording the timing and sequence of neural events but cannot pinpoint the exact brain regions involved. Therefore, the choice between these two techniques depends on the specific research questions and goals.

fMRI is well-suited for investigating questions related to brain localization and connectivity. For example, it can identify which areas of the brain are active during language processing or emotion regulation and reveal how different regions interact during these processes. Moreover, fMRI can examine resting-state connectivity to uncover intrinsic brain networks, shedding light on the brain's intrinsic organization and its relevance to various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

EEG, with its high temporal resolution, is ideal for studying the brain's response to stimuli and events in real-time. Researchers can use EEG to investigate questions related to sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive processing. It is often employed to study the timing of neural responses to specific stimuli or to track changes in brain activity during different phases of a cognitive task.

Additionally, EEG is valuable for clinical applications such as diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders like epilepsy. It can detect abnormal patterns of electrical activity in the brain, aiding in the localization of epileptic foci and guiding treatment decisions.

In conclusion, fMRI and EEG are complementary neuroimaging techniques that offer unique insights into brain organization and cognitive processes. fMRI provides precise spatial information about brain activation and connectivity, making it suitable for questions related to brain localization and networks. In contrast, EEG excels in capturing the timing and dynamics of neural events, making it invaluable for studying real-time cognitive processes. The choice between these methods depends on the specific research goals and the temporal or spatial aspects of brain function under investigation. Together, they have greatly expanded our understanding of how the brain is organized and how the mind functions, providing a multifaceted view of the complex organ that governs human cognition and behavior.","Make this elaborate and detailed as an essay format (no headings), but at least 510 words and convincing enough to be written by a college student.

Input for ChatGPT: Write an essay discussing the negative effects water fluoridation has on humans using reliable sources.",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,91,Likely AI,100,99.9,99.88,"Water fluoridation, a common practice in many countries, involves adding fluoride to public water supplies with the intention of preventing tooth decay. Despite its widespread adoption and support from dental health organizations, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting potential negative effects on human health. This essay aims to explore the adverse impacts of water fluoridation on humans, drawing from reliable sources to present a comprehensive view of this contentious issue.



One primary concern surrounding water fluoridation is its potential impact on cognitive function, particularly in children. A systematic review published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives (Choi et al., 2012) found a strong association between high fluoride exposure and decreased cognitive function in children. The study highlighted the need for more rigorous research to fully understand the neurotoxic effects of fluoride.



Moreover, several studies have raised concerns about the impact of fluoride on bone health. Excessive fluoride intake has been linked to skeletal fluorosis, a condition characterized by pain and damage to the bones and joints (Akosu et al., 2018). This condition, once thought to be limited to areas with naturally high fluoride levels, has been reported in areas with artificially fluoridated water (Peckham et al., 2015). This suggests a potential risk of skeletal fluorosis in populations exposed to higher-than-recommended fluoride levels.



Another notable concern revolves around the potential for fluoride to disrupt the endocrine system. The National Research Council (NRC) in its comprehensive review identified fluoride as an endocrine disruptor that may affect thyroid function (NRC, 2006). Disruptions in thyroid function can have cascading effects on various physiological processes, leading to concerns about overall health.



Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that fluoride may have adverse effects on reproductive health. Research published in the Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering (Moghadam et al., 2014) found that high fluoride concentrations in drinking water were associated with decreased fertility rates in both men and women. This raises concerns about the potential impact of water fluoridation on population-level reproductive health.



It is essential to note that while many studies suggest potential negative effects of water fluoridation, there is ongoing debate within the scientific community. Proponents argue that the concentrations used in water fluoridation are within safe limits and that the benefits to dental health outweigh the potential risks. However, the precautionary principle suggests that in the absence of conclusive evidence of safety, caution should be exercised, especially when it comes to public health interventions.



In conclusion, water fluoridation, a widely adopted practice to prevent tooth decay, has come under scrutiny due to potential negative effects on human health. Evidence suggests associations between high fluoride exposure and cognitive impairment, skeletal fluorosis, disruptions in the endocrine system, and adverse impacts on reproductive health. While the scientific community continues to debate the risks and benefits of water fluoridation, it is crucial to consider the potential harm to human health and explore alternative approaches to maintaining dental health without compromising overall well-being.","ChatGTP

America is not quite known to be one of the healthiest countries in the world. There are many conventional behaviors that Americans must reconsider due to health concerns, such as diet, over-medication, and sedentary lifestyles. A more recent topic that has been a cause for concern is the fluoridation in water supplies. Fluoride is a mineral that can be found in toothpaste, mouthwash, and drinking water. It has been widely accepted for years that the process of adding fluoride to water helps prevent cavities and tooth decay by strengthening tooth enamel. However, some believe that ingesting fluoride has adverse side effects on the human body. Not only is it difficult to measure the amount of fluoride humans ingest daily, but analyzing the before and after effects of water fluoridation is nearly impossible. It seems as though most of the data representing the benefits of water fluoridation is outdated and based on populations that have fluoridated water. There are also other minerals that are not considered in helping prevent cavities, such as magnesium and calcium. The biggest concern of water fluoridation, however, is how fluoride may cause certain conditions, such as hyperthyroidism, dental and skeletal fluorosis, and cancer, to name a few. Although the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water has been supported for decades by dentists and reputable organizations, it is unnecessary to continue water fluoridation in America's water supply.



The effects of fluoride on tooth enamel are not as effective as they are made out to be. Researchers initially correlated the decrease in cavities with the increase in water fluoridation. In order to produce conclusive results, however, the scientific method suggests creating independent and dependent variables to appropriately measure certain outcomes. An article published in The Scientific World Journal states that it is difficult to measure a starting point for bone damage, and the amount of ingested fluoride to begin with. The outdated data that the benefits of fluoridation rely heavily on also presents another flaw. The Harvard Public Health Magazine concluded that much of the research done prior to 1975 failed to take into consideration that fluoride was also being added to toothpastes and other dental hygiene products. As other countries recognized this vital piece of information, or just simply did not fluoridate their water, the rates in cavities still decreased. Therefore, the data, or lack thereof, proves that there is no substantial evidence of water fluoridation decreasing cavities.



It is often suggested that infants and children are to drink fluoridated water to help build strong teeth. One measured study in Iowa, however, claims that 90% of 3-month-olds ingested over the recommended amount of fluoride, with some babies taking in more than 6mg of fluoride daily. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization consider this to be an unsafe amount that may result in skeletal fluorosis, a painful disease caused by excess fluoride in the bones. In fact, the National Research Council reports that about 41% of children in the United States already have some degree of dental fluorosis and that the occurrences of fluorosis are ""higher in areas where water is fluoridated"".



Fluoride is not the only component that is said to contribute to strong teeth. Calcium is known to help build strong bones too, which makes diet an important consideration when exploring this topic. In fact, the process of intaking fluoride to strengthen tooth enamel actually depends on other minerals, like calcium and magnesium. Deficiencies in these compounds are reported to amplify the harmful effects that fluoride has on the body, which can be associated with high potassium levels and a life-threatening heart condition. Water fluoridation may also increase the chances of tooth decay in a person who is not getting an adequate amount of other minerals in their diet.



Many studies done on fluoridation typically focus on data collected from observations on defined populations. Although these studies have always suggested that populations with water fluoridation see a decrease in tooth decay, one in particular indicates that there is a strong correlation between excessive fluoride intake and cancers, like uterine cancer, bladder cancer, and osteosarcoma. Another study that focused on physiological analysis, as opposed to population based analysis, was done by the National Research Council in the USA for the Environmental Protection Agency. The results indicated that fluoridation causes harmful effects, such as ""cognitive impairment, hyperthyroidism, dental and skeletal fluorosis, enzyme and electrolyte derangement, and cancer"".



Organizations like the American Cancer Society make it seem as though there is no harm in fluoride. According to the ACS, most of the studies that have been done in regards to fluoride and its possible link to cancer do not show any conclusive results. However, the organization mentions that the data collected in these studies were also ""retrospective"", or looking back in time. Therefore, there were no controlled variables, which serves as an ineffective experimental method. It is understandable as to why the American Cancer Society does not want to portray a common practice such as water fluoridation as a questionable link to cancer, but that is exactly what it is.



The American Dental Association only provides a one-sided view about the effects of fluoride-all beneficial, of course. The prevention of tooth decay and cavities are their main proponents. They also mention that fluoride is naturally-occurring in water, insinuating that it should not be feared. However, carbon monoxide is also a natural gas found in water, which is known to be poisonous to humans. Another article from the ADA even mentions that they support the studies conducted in Canada on fluoride and its effects on pregnant women. This is rather disturbing as a developing fetus is sensitive to certain substances such as alcohol, drugs, and even some types of food.",

Write a marketing critique on the following article:

No one walking into the theater actually knew what the Barbie movie was going to be about, but everyone went anyway-dressed in pink. The phrase ""Barbie is everything""is true. Barbie pink and the iconic logo have been practically everywhere and on everything since Warner Bros. dropped a first look in April 2022 of Margot Robbie as Barbie sitting in her pink convertible. It's estimated that over $150 million was spent on the film's marketing campaign, more than its production budget of $145 million, Vanity Fair reported. Barbie marketing included everything from an Airbnb Barbie DreamHouse rental and a Barbie boat cruise on the Boston Harbor, to pink burgers at Burger Kings in Brazil and Progressive insurance commercials. More traditional marketing came in the forms of teaser trailers reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Times Square billboards, and an Instagram countdown to opening night. ""I won't comment on the budget,""Josh Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of global marketing, told Vanity Fair. ""The reason people think we spent so much is that it's so ubiquitous. That's a combination of paid media and how many partners came to play with us. Because it pierced the zeitgeist, it has the impression that we spend so much. In fact, we spent responsibly for an event movie.""Neither Warner Bros. nor Mattel, owner of the Barbie brand, immediately responded to Fortune's request for comment. You know you're in the zeitgeist if you're a trending meme Director Greta Gerwig's Barbie brought in over $160 million in ticket sales during its opening weekend, making it the biggest debut ever for a film directed by a woman. But you can't talk about Barbie without talking about Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, a film about the creator of the atomic bomb that was released on the same day. Social media had a major part to play in their mutual success. The meme-ification of Barbie-Oppenheimer (a.k.a. ""Barbenheimer"") helped result in $311 million in combined ticket sales. This made the past weekend the fourth highest-grossing domestic box office weekend in history, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, according to the New York Times. The Internet seemed to take to the ironic and self-aware tone of Barbie. One of the film's taglines read, ""If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.""""We wanted to recognize there were legions of Barbie fans, but that Barbie had quite a history and there are people who felt like Barbie wasn't for them,""Warner Bros.'

With a

marketing budget of more than $150 million and a production budget of $145 million, Barbie

managed to draw in movie-goers with no context of what the movie would be about. What did

this marketing campaign include to bring in over $160 million in ticket sales its opening

weekend? The Barbie marketing team ensured the film's success by splashing pink around the

world. Aside from traditional marketing through use of teaser trailers, Times Square billboards,

and an Instagram countdown to the film's premier, they also provided a pink Airbnb Barbie

DreamHouse rental, a Barbie boat cruise on Boston Harbor, Progressive Insurance

advertisements sporting Barbie pink uniforms, and even offering pink burgers at Burger King in

Brazil. The marketing team also broadened their target audience by using the tagline ""If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you,""intentionally

acknowledging all of the Barbie fans, as well as those who never felt like Barbie was for them.



Due to the pink overload in the months leading up to the premier, the internet began to

make memes of the Barbie movie, which also increased its international promotion. Some

memes joked about the marketing team by posting images of pink sunsets, pink-colored lakes,

pink dolphins, etc., with captions like ""The Barbie Marketing team has done it again.""Other

memes included the use of Oppenhemier, a movie about the atomic bomb that debuted the same day as Barbie, by combining the two opposing personalities of the films to form

Barbie-Oppenheimer, or ""Barbenheimer,""as the internet called it. The frequent social media

exposure to the Barbie movie definitely helped the marketing team in reaching their goals. Some even referred to the Barbie film and its marketing as being in the zeitgeist. However, the one unsuccessful marketing strategy by Mattel, the toy company of Barbie dolls, involved giving

away free Barbie dolls to children in schools, which did not fare well with many people.



For this article, we can start by analyzing the promotion decision process of Barbie's

marketing strategy. It is clear that in their planning phase, they identified their target audience,

which was everyone who is already loyal to the Barbie brand, and everyone who felt like Barbie

was not really for them. While seemingly risky, broadening their target audience in this manner

helped the success of the film. We do not know for sure what their initial budget was in the

planning phase, but it is revealed that their final budget came to more than $150 million. This

was more than their production budget, and the fact that they spent more money on marketing

also seemed to grab people's attention. In terms of their promotional tools, their marketing team

got innovative by creating Barbie-like experiences to draw attention to the film. For instance, the

Airbnb Barbie DreamHouse and the Barbie boat cruise gave people the opportunity to feel like

they are Barbie, and inherently provided a positive association with the Barbie film. According

to the article, the marketing team began promoting the Barbie film in April 2022 with a teaser

trailer of Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie in the movie, driving a pink convertible. Therefore,

we can conclude that the marketing team scheduled the promotion prior to this date. It also

seems as though the promotion was run internationally, considering the pink burgers sold at

Burger King in Brazil as part of the marketing campaign. As far as the implementation phase of

the promotion decision process goes, we cannot know, based off of this article, how the pretest of the promotion went, but we can say that they did begin to carry it out in April 2022, as stated

previously. We also cannot identify, based on this article alone, if any changes were made and

how they assessed the promotion program. I do believe that after receiving the negative feedback about the Barbie dolls being given to children in schools may have been a pain point that they decided to roll back on. Some people mentioned that it was repulsive to push stealth marketing, or advertising that promotes without being overly promotional, onto children, which could be detrimental to the Barbie brand as a whole. A toy company certainly does not want to be associated with deceiving children. However, we can surmise that overall the marketing team

may have determined the promotion program to be a success, considering all of the buzz and

lucrative earnings.



It is imperative to note that many of these strategies, if any at all, would have been

successful without the establishment of the Barbie brand. For decades, the Barbie brand has

managed to emit an aura of fun, youthful, playfulness that is trendy and pink. These traits elicit

positive emotions to be affiliated with the brand. This positivity was also able to draw such stark

differences between the dark, realistic Oppenheimer and the bright, fun-loving Barbie in the

memes mentioned above. This allowed for the memes' virality, and consequently widespread

promotion. Not to mention, the obtainable Barbie-like experiences involved in the marketing

campaign could have also contributed to the success of the film because people wanted to feel

positive emotions by having fun and being playful. The fulfillment of the consumers' experience

as Barbie might have also helped create an insistence to see the film. The marketing team

recognized the importance of how a brand creates an aspirational lifestyle based on the

consumers' loyalty and built on it. They have now added value to the Barbie brand with the

success of the movie, which in turn can result in more respect for the brand and can help in

future endeavors, like a Barbie sequel. Regardless, it is evident that Barbie is now an even

stronger brand than before thanks to its improved perception with the film and marketing

experiences.",
3286,1- Entirely written by me,"Americans' rights were completely stripped from the concept of slavery. Abolishing slavery meant restoring the civil rights in which the slaves should have possessed in the first place. It could show that the Old Constitution only applied to whites when it should have applied to the United States as a whole. With the south supporting slavery for labor benefits, tensions were created and the Civil War occurred.



* The Civil War occurred because the South left the Union and war broke out to conserve the Union. Slowly as the war progressed, events occurred to shift the purpose of the Civil War. The North wanted the Union to preserve because if the Union broke up, it would mean they failed the founding father of America. In reality, the southern states were set on supporting slavery which means the North was actually fighting for the abolishment of slavery. The war's main purpose was to save the Union. The southern states left the Union after the announcement that slavery was going to abolish. Before the war occurred, slavery was legalized and therefore, all the slaveowners were used to the concept of slavery. As time progressed, slavery was in the process of trying to stop slowly, but could never be achieved. Slaves tried to revolt and many abolitionists tried to spread the idea of the removal of slavery. With slavery being legal for quite some time, slaveowners' businesses ran at the expense of slaves. If slavery becomes abolished, all slaveowners suffer and will have to replace their workforce. At first, the North just wanted to fight in order to get the South to come back to the union so everyone can be united. If the Union doesn't restore with the North and South reunited, it could create long-term problems. The Confederacy was set on the fact that slavery should remain and therefore, the north ended up fighting to fully abolish slavery. Abolitionists worked way too hard to come this far just to not reach their goal to get rid of slavery. For years and years, abolitionists were slowly trying to lead to this change. Slaves also knew the history that was about to occur, therefore, slaves joined forces with the North to help them fight against the South to guarantee victory. Slaves joining the fighting force makes it seem like the slaves were fighting the South to defend their human rights that the South doesn't believe they should have. The Confederacy believed that slaves didn't deserve civil rights because they are inferior compared to whites. The slaves fighting against them makes it seem like they are fighting against slavery while the southern states are protecting it. John Brown is an abolitionist who has been fighting against slavery for a while, but during the civil war, he played a big role in defining what the civil war was actually revolving around. Brown tried to free the slaves without violence involved, but knowing the situation he knew it was inevitable. He admits, ""I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.""Brown could show that he was trying to abolish slavery, but in doing so, he knew that some violence would be involved which is the Civil War. Brown gets seventeen whites and five African Americans to take part in Brown's raid in Harper Ferry. Deep down, combining forces between the two races can tick off the South because they want to keep the African American as slaves and not as equals. It was studied that people believed that slaves were cowardly. The violence during this raid fed into the Civil War creating more tensions. The person that fed into the real purpose of the Civil War was Abraham Lincoln himself. The president has the power and the voice to project changes against America compared to a normal colonist or a rich landowner. With that power, Lincoln announced that slavery was going to be abolished and all the downsides of slavery.The Civil War would have never occured in this time frame if Lincoln just allowed slavery to take over, but Lincoln himself was supporting the slaves and the abolitionists by moving America towards a slave-less place. The south knew that if a Republican president were to take office, the future of slavery would be at stake. Then, Abraham Lincoln was elected as the president and just as told, the future of slavery was at stake which caused the Union to split. The south knew that having a Republican president, slavery was going to be worked against as America will start to evolve into a new place. The books states, ""Those who favored secession drew on the symbols and rhertoric of the American Revolution to declare their independence, as an oppressed minority, from the tyranny of Republican Rule.""This can show that the people who withdrew from the Union not only was trying to keep slavery, but because they wanted to avoid because ruled by Republicans. Abraham Lincoln being elected in general already made the Confederacy in danger of leaving the Union.

The North wanted the Union to preserve because if the Union broke up, it would mean they failed the founding father of America. In reality, the southern states were set on supporting slavery which means the North was actually fighting for the abolishment of slavery. The war's main purpose was to save the Union. The southern states left the Union after the announcement that slavery was going to abolish. Before the war occurred, slavery was legalized and therefore, all the slaveowners were used to the concept of slavery. As time progressed, slavery was in the process of trying to stop slowly, but could never be achieved. Slaves tried to revolt and many abolitionists tried to spread the idea of the removal of slavery. With slavery being legal for quite some time, slaveowners' businesses ran at the expense of slaves. If slavery becomes abolished, all slaveowners suffer and will have to replace their workforce. At first, the North just wanted to fight in order to get the South to come back to the union so everyone can be united. If the Union doesn't restore with the North and South reunited, it could create long-term problems. The Confederacy was set on the fact that slavery should remain and therefore, the north ended up fighting to fully abolish slavery. Abolitionists worked way too hard to come this far just to not reach their goal to get rid of slavery. For years and years, abolitionists were slowly trying to lead to this change. Slaves also knew the history that was about to occur, therefore, slaves joined forces with the North to help them fight against the South to guarantee victory. Slaves joining the fighting force makes it seem like the slaves were fighting the South to defend their human rights that the South doesn't believe they should have. The Confederacy believed that slaves didn't deserve civil rights because they are inferior compared to whites. The slaves fighting against them makes it seem like they are fighting against slavery while the southern states are protecting it. John Brown is an abolitionist who has been fighting against slavery for a while, but during the civil war, he played a big role in defining what the civil war was actually revolving around. Brown tried to free the slaves without violence involved, but knowing the situation he knew it was inevitable. He admits, ""I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.""Brown could show that he was trying to abolish slavery, but in doing so, he knew that some violence would be involved which is the Civil War. Brown gets seventeen whites and five African Americans to take part in Brown's raid in Harper Ferry. Deep down, combining forces between the two races can tick off the South because they want to keep the African American as slaves and not as equals. It was studied that people believed that slaves were cowardly. The violence during this raid fed into the Civil War creating more tensions. The person that fed into the real purpose of the Civil War was Abraham Lincoln himself. The president has the power and the voice to project changes against America compared to a normal colonist or a rich landowner. With that power, Lincoln announced that slavery was going to be abolished and all the downsides of slavery.The Civil War would have never occured in this time frame if Lincoln just allowed slavery to take over, but Lincoln himself was supporting the slaves and the abolitionists by moving America towards a slave-less place. The south knew that if a Republican president were to take office, the future of slavery would be at stake. Then, Abraham Lincoln was elected as the president and just as told, the future of slavery was at stake which caused the Union to split. The south knew that having a Republican president, slavery was going to be worked against as America will start to evolve into a new place. The books states, ""Those who favored secession drew on the symbols and rhertoric of the American Revolution to declare their independence, as an oppressed minority, from the tyranny of Republican Rule.""This can show that the people who withdrew from the Union not only was trying to keep slavery, but because they wanted to avoid because ruled by Republicans. Abraham Lincoln being elected in general already made the Confederacy in danger of leaving the Union. The true Civil War was not fighting against each other, but fighting against the people who supported slavery and the people who wanted to abolish it.",

Science is a vast term with many theories and unanswered questions behind the subject. The entire world is made up of science, and it has the ability to leave people wondering or in disbelief. With technology and other technical advances, the science behind it can leave people in a state of limbo. Society isn't sure if they want to support it or be against it, all due to the misunderstanding of the science. By science, it doesn't fully mean the reason why things occur, but it can mean the effects, how people feel towards it, or what a person can believe about how something occurs. The term science can vary from one person to another because everyone thinks differently and there isn't a definite answer. Scientific knowledge has become more individual as the years have gone by. One person might believe in scientific knowledge, but another might have other misconceptions on the same topic. Science has become a subject of belief because everyone has their own opinions about it even though there is evidence of the science behind it, yet people believe different things, positive or negative. People see the scientific knowledge of technology and vaccines, making science a subject of belief due to a lack of understanding of how both work.

Vaccines are created to prevent outbreaks from occurring within a society. For vaccines to have full effectiveness, everyone in a population has to take the vaccine to prevent the further spreading of diseases. The only problem with vaccines is that within a society, people don't trust the science behind them. Despite the information backing up vaccines with science, people still hesitate to trust them. Eula Biss, in ""Sentimental Medicine,"" talks about the effects of vaccines and the mentality that people had behind discovering the science behind vaccines. Biss states, ""I was aware, before I became pregnant, of some fears around vaccination. But I was not prepared for the labyrinthine network of anxieties I would discover during my pregnancy...""(Biss 33). A significant factor when it comes to misconceptions about science is emotions. Just as Biss stated, an emotion like fear can cause a person to have certain beliefs. In this case, fear made her rethink the power of vaccines, showing that science can become misconstrued beliefs. Doctors have the science behind vaccines to show their purpose and effectiveness, so why do people still doubt them? Doctors possess the title to be professionals explaining vaccines to them, and with the information given, people make science a subject of belief. Everyone has the entitlement to base their opinions on certain things. The reason society refuses to take vaccines is not that science persuades that vaccines are bad, but due to the belief they have in science. If science were not a subject of belief, people wouldn't have opinions on vaccines and would just support the movement behind them. In this case, the subject of belief in the science of vaccines is negative because of not supporting it. Biss also states, ""When the last nationwide smallpox epidemic began in 1898, some people believed that whites were not susceptible to the disease""(Biss 34). Something that is one person's belief can also spread and make others support the same reasoning behind the thought. There was no science to back up this assumption about smallpox, yet people believed that it was true. In this case, one person's belief was spread to make the whole community or world believe the same thoughts, that smallpox was not susceptible to a certain skin color or race. The reason evidence was not able to be provided about this claim is that people didn't understand why. Not knowing why allows people to make their assumptions due to the lack of knowledge provided about the topic to fill in the gap. When a person doesn't have an answer, people either leave it as it is or create that ""belief""that can provide them with satisfaction in not understanding. People refused to take vaccines without the qualifications of defining whether it was negative or positive because science has become a subject of belief.

In addition to vaccines, technology plays a significant role in society, and the scientific knowledge behind technology is not perfect. Technology is a very complex subject, and not everyone understands the science behind it. Humans have started to rely on technology because of the positive outcomes it has created for the community, and many processes have been affected. Technology or specifically algorithms provide endless possibilities that can still be expanded or improved upon to this day. Franklin Foer in ""Mark Zuckerberg's War on Free Will""discusses the effects of algorithms and how they have affected our society. Unlike vaccines, when it comes to algorithms, all beliefs are positive because they are accepted by society, making society see them differently. The only thing is that people don't understand the science behind algorithms and exactly how they work, yet people support them. Technology is a very sophisticated topic with endless abilities that society hasn't fully grasped and probably won't be able to grasp due to technology getting better every day. Foer states, ""Algorithms were always interesting and valuable, but advances in computing made them infinitely more powerful""(Foer 111). Algorithms have an infinite power to help society, and people don't understand how, but they understand the power behind them. Just like vaccines, not everyone understands the science behind them, but people choose to trust them and use them. Many companies use algorithms to help them do everyday things such as organizing data. Foer also states, ""Both Amazon and Netflix use algorithms to make recommendations about books and films. These algorithms seek to understand our tastes and the taste of like-minded consumers of culture""(Foer 111). Amazon and Netflix use algorithms to their advantage for their companies, showing that both companies believe in the power of technology, and therefore, they use it. Amazon and Netflix are both subject to the belief that algorithms can help them, resulting in their daily use for their companies. People don't grasp the full coverage of the science behind technology or algorithms, yet people chose to have a subject of belief in the power of technology.

Lastly, people didn't believe the science behind humans and technology. As technology has impacted society, there have been moments of collaboration between humans and technology. Collaboration allows two or more things or people to come together to enhance or improve what a single person or thing could possibly do. Humans use technology every day, but as technology first started arising, no one knew its possibilities. It was scientific knowledge that people discovered as the years went by, and people used it more and more. At first, it was a belief because not everyone knew what technology was or if people believed in the power it could harness. Technology was able to break barriers that were experienced before, and with the collaboration between technology and humans, only good things were going to come from it. Cathy Davidson in ""Project Classroom Makeover""talks about the collaboration between humans and technology and the feelings towards the change. Davidson states, ""iPods could be used for collective learning. They turned the iPods into social media and networked their learning in ways we did not anticipate""(Davidson 49). iPods were a new piece of technology that entered society and was supposed to enhance learning because it gave the option to access information from anywhere rather than just school. It was a new scientific knowledge that has been created to be able to spread knowledge worldwide wherever someone had access to an iPod as well. The subject of belief was that the iPod was not used for learning anymore but for entertainment and other purposes that weren't gaining new knowledge. The scientific knowledge proved that the iPod was going to",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,40,Likely Human,32.31,0.02,0,"Knowledge To Belief

Slavery is something that has been around a long time, in the past time period. The only thing is that with certain effects, slavery became a more common thing where there were rules and basically became optimized. Landowners, or just wealthy people, used slavery to benefit them to create money. The eagerness for money started taking over many people and made them do anything for money anyway while doing less work. This drive for just more money and riches greatly affected the system of slavery in many ways. Colonists kept traveling in the hopes of new land and with the new land came new ways to make money. As land was being discovered, cash crops were found, and were in need of more people to tend to the crops. Cash crops were a ticket to riches such as tobacco. These colonists were finding land rich in cash crops which made the demand for slavery increase. The greater the amount of farmland that was being created, the greater the number of people were being enslaved. More land results in more people having to work on that land. With the constant factors affecting slavery, it eventually transformed into a system that people would never have expected.

Many factors have affected slavery since the beginning when the concept was created. At the time, colonizers were looking for land with the hopes that they would run into a plot of land to bring them riches. Lands could be filled with many resources which led to wealth so the thought of claiming a new piece of land was a good source for money. The book states, ""Colonists violently seized land from the native inhabitants of the Americas and forcibly enslaved millions of Africans to provide labor for their New World settlements.""The first factor to affect slavery was labor work. Labor work is a process that has to be done in order to acquire the ability to make money. The only problem is that these colonists definitely wouldn't want to do the work and the solution to not working and making money is to make someone else do the work for you. The colonists saw these African Americans when seizing the land which caused them to target African Americans to enslave them to start doing labor work. With violence and force on these people, started the process of slavery. The next factor that really negatively affected the system of slavery is greed. When someone works for you, you would have to pay them. Indentured servants were people who were working without a salary because they owed money to people. The difference between indentured servants and slaves was that the owners would eventually give the indentured servants land whenever the money that was owed is repaid. In the north, wages for indentured servants and slaves toiled down to the point where colonists are able to benefit fully from the slaves' labor work without having to pay them a single dime. Greed is a strong trait that could lead to negative effects such as not paying workers for their work. The effects of cash crops were also superior. Cash crops made landowners loads of money and were focused when it came to plantations. Cash crops were the key to fortune and people who were tending to these cash crops were the slaves. In this case, the slaves were the perfect people to tend to the abundant amount of cash crops which made landowners care less about slaves. In their eyes, the slaves were just a tool in order to make their money while saving them money. Getting workers compared to slaves, the prices were extremely different. Most slaves got nothing from the labor and just had to deal with it.

As the factors started affecting slavery, the transformation started to take place in how slavery worked. Slaves in the north were tired of being treated with such bad quality and having no pay. On top of that, slaves didn't even possess the ability to vote because of their social status with money. The result of this made slaves start to fight back to resist enslavement which caused colonists to create a stricter system. The book states, ""Many slaves had some rights, and slave status rarely passed from parent to child. Some slaves could work for their freedom; some married into the families that held them; some even owned property. But slavery had harsher aspects too.""Slavery transformed into something negative that made it very hard to get out of. Once you were in slavery, even your future family would be stuck in the process or classified as a slave as well. There were little to no ways to get out of slavery because wealthy landowners liked the thought of someone working for them which they overpowered with the price of nothing out of their own pockets. As a result, the slave system became more strict and strict. If you were labeled as a slave, you barely had any say and didn't have much as your human rights. The main reason that caused the system of slavery to transform into the atrocious name as people know it now is because of the desire for slaves by these rich landowners. As a result, slavery transformed into something that was a nightmare. Slaves didn't like the treatment they were getting and so it caused protests and violence in order to go against the wealthy landowners. All the harsh treatment was not withstandable any longer. The cynical treatment of slaves led to Bacon's Rebellion. The rebellion was the turning point of slavery when slaves were no longer accepting the fate that they were stuck in for years. African American slaves and white indentured servants came together to go against the government and were the first rebellion to start the end of slavery.

Cash crops played a big factor in the creation of slavery. Colonists constantly were migrating in hopes to find a certain place they could settle down and make money to live happily ever after. Eventually, an area would be found, which colonists would start settling down and creating a business with this new land. The triangular trade introduced these colonists into something that we know as slaves. As a result, the triangular trade gave the colonists the ability to obtain slaves in exchange for a little number of their cash crops. In a way, it was an investment, they would give away some of their cash crops in exchange for slaves that would work for them and make more of the crops. Colonists were willing to lose some crops as the demand for labor was really high. The book states, "" Slave trading would prove extremely lucrative, becoming part of a large commerce referred to as the triangular trade that took European goods to Africa, slaves to America, and New World produce back to Europe.""(25). Without the drive to find new land and cash crops, slavery would have not have been created. The invasion of Native Americans as they fought back made colonists back off and find a new group of people to create ""workers"". After the Native Americans, the colonists decided to get servants from England, but it was not cost-efficient. In the end, the colonists enslaved African Americans and overpowered them which is the creation of slavery.

 As you can see, slavery has evolved over the years from many factors. From greed to money, all these factors play a big part in slavery because all these factors made landowners take advantage of slaves and keep them in a bad environment. The landowners didn't care about the treatment of slaves because, in their eyes, they were getting rich and doing no labor work. The benefits for the landowners were too great in order for them to feel a certain humanly thought for the slaves. As a result, slavery started transforming into the super negative thing that everyone in the world knows it as now. The system changed to something so detrimental that it even became hard to get out of slavery the second you are. The second you were in slavery, it was nearly impossible to get out of slavery. Especially in the North, things were a lot more strict and started to get out of hand where people started becoming property. Slaves' rights were suppressed to the fullest where they had no ability or say for the conditions that they were stuck in. At the time, landowners had the most power and say because they were rich compared to the slaves. From finding new land to paying servants, to completely overpowering people, slavery changed over time.

This essay aims to present the teleological argument, identify the best objection to it, and evaluate whether this objection successfully undermines the argument's validity.

The teleological argument asserts that the intricate design and order found in the universe suggest the existence of an intelligent designer, often referred to as God. Advocates of this argument argue that the universe exhibits remarkable features, such as the fine-tuning of physical constants, the complexity of biological organisms, and the beauty and orderliness of the cosmos. They contend that these phenomena are not the result of random chance but rather indicate a purposeful arrangement, implying the existence of a divine creator.

One version of the teleological argument is the ""fine-tuning argument,"" which highlights the precise calibration of fundamental physical constants that allow life to exist. For instance, slight alterations in the values of constants like the gravitational constant or the strength of electromagnetic forces would render the universe inhospitable to life as we know it. Advocates of the teleological argument argue that the probability of these constants aligning so perfectly for life to emerge by chance is exceedingly low, making it more reasonable to posit an intelligent designer who fine-tuned them.

Now, let's turn our attention to the most compelling objection to the teleological argument, which is often referred to as the ""argument from natural explanations."" This objection posits that the apparent order and complexity in the universe can be adequately explained by natural processes, such as evolution in the case of biological complexity or anthropic principles in the case of fine-tuning.

In the context of biological complexity, proponents of natural explanations argue that the diversity of life and its apparent design can be attributed to the process of evolution by natural selection. Over billions of years, organisms have evolved and adapted to their environments through a series of incremental changes, resulting in the complex and diverse life forms we observe today. This gradual, natural process offers a plausible explanation for the appearance of design without requiring the intervention of an intelligent creator.

Similarly, in the case of fine-tuning, proponents of natural explanations assert that the existence of multiple universes or the anthropic principle can account for the observed fine-tuning of physical constants. The multiverse hypothesis suggests that our universe is just one of many, each with different sets of physical constants. In this scenario, it is not surprising that we find ourselves in a universe where the constants allow for life because we could only exist in such a universe. The anthropic principle argues that the universe's parameters must be compatible with the existence of intelligent observers, as we can only observe a universe that permits our existence.

The objection from natural explanations challenges the necessity of invoking a divine creator to account for the order and complexity in the universe. Instead, it proposes that natural processes, guided by physical laws and principles, are sufficient to explain the observed phenomena.

In evaluating the objection, it is essential to consider whether it successfully undermines the teleological argument. While the objection provides plausible alternative explanations for the apparent design in the universe, it does not definitively disprove the existence of a divine creator. The objection points to natural processes as potential explanations, but it does not rule out the possibility of a creator who initiated or designed these processes.

Furthermore, the teleological argument is inherently a matter of belief and interpretation. Some individuals may find the argument persuasive and see the hand of a creator in the order and complexity of the universe, while others may find natural explanations more compelling. The objection from natural explanations, therefore, serves as a counterargument but does not conclusively refute the teleological argument.

In conclusion, the teleological argument posits the existence of an intelligent creator based on the apparent order and complexity in the universe. The most robust objection to this argument comes in the form of natural explanations, which propose that the observed phenomena can be adequately explained by natural processes, such as evolution and anthropic principles. While this objection provides plausible alternatives, it does not definitively disprove the existence of a divine creator. The validity of the teleological argument remains a matter of philosophical interpretation and belief, making it a topic of ongoing debate within the realm of philosophy and theology.","I have used ChatGPT for all my submissins.

Essentially, it suggests that, given initial conditions and the laws governing the universe, every occurrence is preordained, with no room for randomness or free will. This essay will delve into the core tenets of determinism, elaborate on the additional assertions made by ""hard determinism,"" explore why numerous philosophers find it disconcerting, and then examine ""soft determinism,"" considering whether it offers a persuasive alternative. Finally, we will explore ""scientific libertarianism"" and discuss whether it is less discernible than conventional determinism.

Determinism, at its most elemental level, asserts that the entire course of events in the universe is governed by causality. This implies that every event, no matter how trivial or momentous, has a cause that can be traced back to previous events, engendering an unbroken chain of causation. In a deterministic perspective, the future is completely determined by the past, leaving no room for chance or free will. One might liken this deterministic viewpoint to a meticulously choreographed ballet performance, where every movement is predetermined, and the dancers possess no agency to deviate from the choreography.

Nevertheless, ""hard determinism"" takes the concept of determinism a step further. Hard determinists contend that not only are our actions and choices predetermined, but also that we lack genuine free will entirely. In other words, our decisions and behaviors are solely the outcome of preceding causes, and we are essentially marionettes, devoid of any capacity to make choices independent of these causes.

The reason many philosophers find hard determinism disconcerting stems from its implications for personal responsibility and moral accountability. If all our actions are predetermined by factors beyond our control, it raises profound questions about whether individuals can be morally culpable for their actions. If a person commits a transgression, for instance, under hard determinism, they had no real option but to commit the misdeed, as their actions were determined by prior events. This challenges traditional notions of justice and retribution.

In contrast, soft determinists propose a more nuanced perspective. They believe that free will can harmonize with determinism in a deterministic universe. According to soft determinism, our actions are, indeed, influenced by various factors, such as our desires, values, and external circumstances. However, they argue that as long as our actions align with our personal desires and values, we can deem them free and morally responsible.

The most compelling version of soft determinism, in my estimation, is one that emphasizes compatibilism, which posits that free will and determinism are not inherently contradictory. In this view, free will does not require complete liberation from external influences but rather entails making choices that align with our genuine preferences and desires. It acknowledges that external factors play a role in shaping our decisions but asserts that as long as we act in accordance with our true selves, we can still possess a meaningful form of free will.

I find this version of soft determinism moderately convincing. It offers a more balanced perspective than hard determinism, acknowledging that external factors do influence our actions while still permitting individual agency. Nevertheless, it does not fully resolve the philosophical dilemmas surrounding free will and determinism, as questions persist about whether our desires themselves are determined by preceding causes, potentially leading to an infinite regression of determinism.

Scientific libertarianism introduces an intriguing twist to the discourse. It draws inspiration from the realm of quantum physics, suggesting that at the quantum level, certain events exhibit genuine randomness. In other words, not everything adheres to a predetermined script, and an element of indeterminacy exists within the universe. Some proponents of scientific libertarianism argue that this quantum indeterminacy provides a foundation for free will, as it introduces an element of unpredictability into the cosmos.

As for whether scientific libertarianism is less conspicuous than traditional determinism, it hinges on one's perspective. On one hand, the notion that some inherent randomness exists in the universe may provide optimism for those seeking to preserve the concept of free will. It implies that not everything is etched in stone and that genuine choices may indeed exist.

Conversely, scientific libertarianism also presents its own set of complexities. The unpredictability introduced by quantum indeterminacy can be disorienting, as it implies that our actions may not invariably follow a rational or predictable pattern. This unpredictability can be as unsettling as the strict determinism of hard determinism.

In summary, determinism, whether in its conventional form or as explored in hard determinism, raises profound questions about free will, personal responsibility, and moral culpability. Soft determinism seeks to find a middle ground by reconciling determinism with free will through compatibilism, offering a compelling perspective but not entirely resolving the complexities of the debate. Scientific libertarianism introduces the notion of quantum indeterminacy, which may provide a source of randomness in the universe but also presents its own intricacies. Ultimately, whether any of these positions is less discernible than strict determinism is subjective and contingent on individual philosophical leanings and the unease one may experience when grappling with the profound implications of these ideas.",write a 971 word essay that follows the below prompt. please make it written as if it were by a first year college student with decent writing skills. can you make it so that it will be less detectable by AI software?

Determinism essentially states that all actions are a result of causes external to free will, or autonomous human choice. In this paper, I will explore a more radical concept of determinism, called hard determinism; a rather lighter concept of determinism, called soft determinism; and a radical concept of free will, called scientific libertarianism.I will argue how Frankfurt's argument of soft determinism is the most convincing argument that relates to determinism, and how hard determinism and scientific libertarianism are both equally disquieting.
I first will discuss the meaning of free will and its relation to the definition of determinism. According to the Stich and Donaldson account of free will, free will suggests that
(1) We have several alternative choices.
(2) We are in control of the choices we choose.
(3) We are also responsible for the choices we make.
As aforementioned, determinism suggests that even if humans were capable of changing the past, history would not change in the slightest. Hard determinism emphasizes this idea and suggests that our actions are dictated by the laws of nature and the earlier state of the universe.Therefore, free will is merely an illusion according to hard determinism as it contradicts the Stich and Donaldson account of free will. Furthermore, according to hard determinism:
(1) We have only one possible course of action as our will is predetermined by the laws of nature and the state of the universe from millions of years ago.
(2) Since the laws of nature and state of the universe have our courses of action predetermined from millions of years ago, we are not in control of the courses of action we choose.
(3) We are therefore not responsible for the choices we make.
I will now explain why many philosophers find hard determinism to be disquieting. According to the three ""rules""of hard determinism, choice is an illusion if hard determinism is true, therefore no one is morally responsible for their actions. This includes acts of violence such as the murder of an innocent child. Arguing that one is not responsible for murdering a child, brings about the question of morality and its existence and/or meaning. In this specific circumstance, one would argue that murdering a child should be excused as it was in accordance with the perpetrator's predetermined will as well as the victim's predetermined will. Hard determinism argues that this course of action could not have been changed regardless of the circumstance. This concept essentially rejects morality in situations where another innocent being is adversely affected because one had this notion that there was no control or alternative choice behind their action. Because of the lack of morality, many philosophers find hard determinism to be rather disquieting.
I will now discuss the concept of soft determinism and delve into why Frankfurt's version of it is the most convincing. Soft determinism suggests that free will and determinism can coexist. According to Hume, a human acts freely if:
1) Their wants and desires lead to their decision.
2) Their decision leads to their actions.
3) There are no obstacles preventing them.
However, if someone was given a potent drug that causes them to commit murder despite resisting, one can argue with Hume's version of soft determinism suggests that one was technically acting under free will. This person had a desire to commit murder, their decision led to the murder, and there were no obstacles preventing them, since they were equipped with weapons per say. However, since someone was under the influence, they are not necessarily morally responsible for their actions. Since Hume's account of free will is satisfied, one is technically not morally responsible for committing murder. This is where we can find a flaw in Hume's argument - the drug given is responsible for the person comitting murder as it raised these desires. Because our decisions and desires are things that we do not choose, according to Hume, our actions are similar to the person being given the drug, hence conveying a flaw in Hume's version of soft determinism. Furthermore, a person could be forced to take the drug or not be notified of the rather bizarre side effects of the drug, thus making them not directly responsible for their actions. Alternatively, Harry Frankfurt proposed that if someone's behavior is caused by desires they want to have, then a person's actions are considered fully free. As compared to Hume, Frankfurt's argument is convincing because of its consideration of the person's own wish to have the desire. Therefore, in the instance where someone was forced to consume a drug that caused them to have the desire to commit murder, their actions would not be deemed free as they did not initally wish to commit murder, and were essentially indirectly forced to do so against their own will. In a broader sense, when discussing mass shootings, many people bring up how the perpetrator is suffering from mental illness that propelled their fatal actions. We can agree that those who have a mental illness did not choose to be mentally ill; when they do terrible things, it is fair to say that their illness does not ameliorate any suffering that people had to experience as a result.This is when we wonder where the blame is placed. One answer is that we can point the blame to society's stigmatization of mental illness or the lack of structure in the medical world that makes it difficult for those with mental illness to receive help. If we lived in a society where there was more support for those with mental illness, perhaps it would be less likely for someone with a mental illness to commit a terrible act.",

Explain why, or why not?",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,16,Likely Human,25,2,20.6,"In The Teleological Argument, William Paley proposes that superb design and obvious function of creatures, objects, and phenomena are key indicators of an intelligent mind, or God that was the creator behind such designs. In the coming centuries, scientist Charles Darwin had proposed several evolutionary theories that directly challenge Paley's argument. Through Darwin's rebuttal, it becomes apparent that the teleological argument is rather flawed. In this paper, I will argue that the teleological argument is invalid due to Darwin's scientific theories of evolution and natural selection.

Paley's teleological argument consists of four premises that are based on the idea of superb design and an intelligent mind:

(P1) Human artifacts are products of intelligent design; they have a purpose.

(P2) The universe resembles these human artifacts.

(P3) Therefore: It is probable that the universe is a product of intelligent design, and has a purpose.

(P4) However, the universe is vastly more complex and gigantic than a human artifact is.

(C) Therefore: There is probably a powerful and vastly intelligent designer who created the universe. (Pecorino)

Paley analogizes his argument with a watch on a heath, in ""Natural Theology.""He explains that after finding and inspecting a watch upon the ground, we come to see ""that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose,""thus indicating ""the existence and agency of such an artist at some former time and in some place or other.""(1-2) This brief explanation of Paley's watch analogy emphasizes the first premise of his argument that essentially explains how a highly functional human artifact is the product of an intelligent mind. In the second and fourth premises, Paley broadens his argument by bringing focus to the entirety of the universe and its vast complexity. Paley lastly hones in on his argument by explaining that the universe mirrors human artifacts but on a much wider scale. Hence, according to Paley, there is a powerful intelligence designer behind this universe, i.e. God.

As I've concluded my summary into Paley's argument and his watch analogy, I will now proceed to explain a key objection to the teleological argument: Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. Charles Darwin dedicated his life to studying human evolution, and by doing so he explained the concept of evolution and natural selection, which go hand in hand when explaining how humans, and other species, have such ""superb design""and functions that have enabled us to survive. Darwin's theory of evolution states that ""all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.""(Darwin) This theory is based off of four premises:

(P1) More individuals are produced than can survive;

(P2) There is therefore a struggle for existence;

(P3) Individuals within a species show variation;

(P4) Offspring tend to inherit their parents' characteristics

The struggle for existence, variation within a species, as well as inheritance, comprise the conditions for natural selection to occur (Than, Taylor). Furthermore, inherited superior traits in a species with genetic variation will help certain, fortunate members of that species survive, hence the survival of the fittest. After generations of reproduction, this species will consist of members with superb design, which directly objects Paley's argument.

Now that I've explained Darwin's evolutionary theory and conveyed how it objects to Paley's argument, I will dive deeper into how Paley's argument is rather broad with the support of the theory of evolution. As Paley simply suggests that there must be an intelligent creator behind the universe, it's important to consider that complexity does not require an intelligent mind; a stack of paper or pile of clothes takes little to no thought to create. Therefore, drawing in a biological perspective to explain the universe's super design and function is far more logical and plausible. Given that once all Galapagos finches used to have smaller beaks that made it difficult to consume water during a drought, but now they have evolved to develop larger beaks, conveys the process of natural selection. (PBS). Random mutation and selective retention have proven to be legitimate as they've been studied in labs, where variation, selection, and retention comprise the evolutionary repertoire that propel complexity in organisms (Donahue).

Darwin's theory of evolution and natural selection explains the superb design and obvious function of the universe and therefore debunk's Paley's teleological argument for the existence of God.",

We need to get to the bottom of this. We're talking about a balance between keeping America safe and protecting our freedoms. It's a tough one, but let's dive in.
First off, let's talk about what's going on. Some people say, ""Hey, this facial recognition stuff is amazing for catching bad guys."" And they're not wrong. It's powerful. It can track down criminals faster than any cop on the beat. But on the other hand, we've got serious concerns. People are worried about their privacy- and rightfully so. They're saying, ""What if this technology gets it wrong?"" And there's evidence it's not always accurate, especially with certain groups. It's a big, big concern.
Here's the heart of the problem: discrimination and civil liberties. We've seen cases where this tech has been, frankly, a disaster for minority communities. It's not always fair, and that's not what America is about. We've got to protect our citizens' rights. Civil liberties are the foundation of our great nation.

However, the vehicle's failure to recognize a pedestrian in its path points to a technological shortcoming. Legally, the matter of accountability becomes even more complex. Uber faced significant scrutiny and suspended its self-driving operations temporarily. Still, the legal system grapples with the appropriate assignment of liability in such technologically complex scenarios, especially when traditional frameworks of vehicular negligence may not readily apply.
As companies like Uber and Tesla advance in developing self-driving cars, they must prioritize safety and ethical considerations alongside technological innovation. This includes rigorous testing protocols, transparent reporting of system limitations, and a commitment to continuous improvement in response to any incidents. Ethical considerations should extend beyond mere compliance with regulations; they need to encompass a proactive approach to public safety and ethical responsibility, especially in scenarios where technology might fail or operate unpredictably.
Regulators and elected officials must consider the broader societal impact of self-driving technology. This includes creating comprehensive safety standards and accountability mechanisms to ensure public trust in these emerging technologies. From a design perspective, principles of 'design justice' could be pivotal. Designers and programmers should focus on creating systems that are not only technically proficient but also ethically aligned with societal values and safety standards. This approach would involve more inclusive design processes, considering potential harm and prioritizing the well-being of all road users, not just vehicle occupants.
The incident involving Uber's self-driving SUV is a stark reminder of the ethical, legal, and moral complexities emerging from the integration of autonomous technologies in our daily lives. It underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to accountability, encompassing both moral responsibility and legal liability. As the technology evolves, a continuous and dynamic dialogue among companies, regulators, designers, and the public is essential to navigate these challenges responsibly. In this rapidly advancing field, our ethical frameworks and legal systems must adapt to ensure safety and public trust in autonomous technologies.",Write a 5 paragraph essay
763,2- Written by me but grammar was corrected by AI,"A growing number of major corporate employers, such as Unilever and Hilton, are incorporating artificial intelligence into their hiring processes to screen candidates' resumes, social networking profiles, and first-round interviews. These kinds of algorithmic tools are sometimes referred to as ""hiretech.""One popular hiretech company is[HireVueLinks to an external site.] (https://www.hirevue.com/), which makes AI systems that conduct and screen video interviews with job candidates in order to identify the most promising applicants (who can then be interviewed by a human recruiter).

In this case study, your assignment is to use concepts and material from class to 1) describe HireVue's algorithm and 2) analyze HireVue's algorithm from an ethical perspective.

First, carefully read thisWashington Postarticle that describes in detail the algorithm and its potential for discriminatory outcomes:[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-scanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/Links to an external site.] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-scanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/).

[Actions] (https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/214474/assignments/2714133#)

).



Then, follow these steps:

Step 1:Do some research about ""hiretech""and the ethical issues it raises. Since theWashington Postarticle linked above is quite comprehensive, you're not required to find additional media articles for this case study (though you are of course welcome to). But you must findat least twoscholarly sourcesthat are relevant to this case- either because they analyze HireVue specifically, because they discuss the potential of algorithmic discrimination in hiring or both.



Step 2:Drawing on the sources you find AND material from class, write a short essay that reflects on the ethics and implications of HireVue's algorithm to screen job applicants. Your memo should be 800-1000 words (not including references). Make sure to cite all your sources!

Your essay must contain the following components:

* Begin with a brief (i.e., no more than a paragraph or two) description of how HireVue's algorithm works. Obviously, the algorithm itself is proprietary and we don't have all the details, so write your description based onyour understandingof the available information. Then, based on theWashington Postarticle provided and class material, answer the following questions:

*

* In class, we have learned about several distinct types of algorithms (regression, clustering, classification, etc). If you were to classify HireVue's video-interview screening tool as one of these types, which would it be?

* Based on your understanding of the HireVue video-interview screening algorithm, is it an example of supervised or unsupervised machine learning?

* What kind of data has HireVue's algorithm been trained on? What are some potential advantages and limitations of this dataset?

* Once you have described what HireVue's algorithm purports to accomplish, how it was trained, and the basics of how it works, the remainder of your essay should discuss theethical implicationsof using HireVue's algorithm for assessing job candidates. Below are some questions to consider (you don't need to address all of these; they are here to spur your thinking). As always, keep in mind that most of these questions do not have a ""correct""answer. Your essay will not be graded based on whether you take a particular position, but rather on the strength of the arguments you make and the reasoning behind them.

*

* In class and in your readings, you have learned about how programmers must sometimes make hard choices between fairness and accuracy when designing algorithms. What kinds of fairness vs. accuracy trade-offs arise when designing an algorithm that screens job applicants?

* Based on what you have learned about HireVue's algorithm, do you think HireVue's programmers got the balance between fairness and accuracy right? If not, how might you change it?

* In January 2021, partially in response to a[third-party auditLinks to an external site.] (https://www.wired.com/story/job-screening-service-halts-facial-analysis-applicants/), HireVue[announcedLinks to an external site.] (https://www.hirevue.com/blog/hiring/industry-leadership-new-audit-results-and-decision-on-visual-analysis)it was eliminating the ""facial expression analysis""aspect of the screening algorithm, on the grounds that ""visual analysis has far less correlation to job performance than other elements of our algorithmic assessment [such as the language used by job applicants in video interviews]"". Does this shift ease concerns about discriminatory outcomes? Why or why not?

* In[a videoLinks to an external site.] (https://www.vox.com/videos/2021/3/31/22348722/ai-bias-racial-machine-learning), computer scientist Deborah Raji says (skip to 18:20 for the start of the relevant clip): ""I do think there are certain situations where we should not be predicting with a machine learning system at all. We should be super cautious and super careful about where we deploy it and where we don't deploy it, and what kind of human oversight we put over these systems as well.""Do you agree with Raji that there are certain situations where machine learning should not be used to make predictions at all? If so, do you think hiring is one of those situations? Why or why not?

",Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,48,Likely Human,48.48,99.92,7.6,"HireVue's algorithm is an AI-driven video interview screening tool designed to assess candidates during job interviews. It analyzes a combination of verbal and non-verbal cues, such as speech patterns, facial expressions, body language, and word choice, to evaluate an applicant's suitability for a role. The algorithm aims to identify key traits that may predict job performance by comparing the candidate's responses to those of successful employees. HireVue's video-interview screening tool can be classified as a classification algorithm. It uses features extracted from candidates' verbal and non-verbal cues to categorize them into groups, such as suitable or unsuitable for a given job. The HireVue algorithm is an example of supervised machine learning. It needs training data from successful candidates' video interviews to learn behavioral patterns. Using these patterns, the algorithm can then predict the suitability of new candidates based on their video interviews. HireVue's algorithm has been trained on a dataset containing thousands of job interviews, including successful and unsuccessful candidates. The potential advantages of this dataset include a large sample size of candidates. However, there are many limitations the algorithm has to offer, such as biases due to the algorithm being trained on a predominantly white, male workforce and lack of transparency due to the proprietary nature of the algorithm is in,

When considering how programmers have to choose between fairness and accuracy when designing algorithms, it is important to understand the problems before coming up with a solution. On the one hand, if we lean towards accuracy rather than fairness, the algorithm might be more biased based on what the training data was trained on. Since the data was based on supervised machine learning, the data is even more likely to be limited. ""Advocates of AI-based hiring processes, however, have a different take on the possibility of any discrimination creeping out during recruitment and selection. All said and done, AI-driven hiring tools are just as biased as the humans who train them."" (Section 3, Proposed Conceptual Model) From ""Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Effective Recruitment and Selection Processes,""we can understand that although the data may not be intended to discriminate against others, the datasets that were provided to the algorithms only have the information that they were given and may indirectly discriminate against gender or racial biases even if they are a suitable candidate. On the other hand, if we lean towards more fairness rather than accuracy, it may lead to more inadequate candidates, leading to future consequences such as layoffs or bankruptcy. To make the algorithm viable, there has to be a balance between fairness and accuracy. A tool that we learned in class would be the Pareto frontier (or Pareto curve), as it ""Constitutes the set of ""reasonable""choices for the trade-off between accuracy and fairness""Although using the Pareto curve may be a good solution, it is not a one solution answer neither can it fit for every business as some professions such as medical diagnosis or financial forecasting may require an algorithm that requires strict accuracy as precision is critical.

Based on what I have learned about HireVue's algorithm, the way HireVue's programmers balanced between fairness and accuracy is a step in the right direction, but in reality, it is just damage control for their algorithm becoming exposed to the public. In the article ""Help Wanted an Examination of Hiring Algorithms, Equity, and Bias,""they quote, ""Importantly, removing or obscuring sensitive factors like gender and race will not prevent predictive models from reflecting patterns of bias.""(Bogen 8) Such as what HireVue did such as removing demographic factors such as age, gender, and race, was not enough to have a definite way of automating the hiring process. Potential ways of fixing the algorithm would stem from identifying where the problem or bias comes from; this could be solved by re-evaluating the algorithm to determine where the biases are coming from, requiring human oversight, adding more diverse candidates to the dataset, communicating with clients and candidates as they should be more transparent to build trust and conduct regular audits to ensure the algorithm remains fair and unbiased.

Eliminating facial expression analysis may ease concerns about discriminatory outcomes, but this does not address other biases in the algorithm, such as language. With the removal of facial expression analysis, this could include an emphasis on language or speech analysis, as candidates that are immigrants may have accents which could lead to biases. Although these factors may not directly connect to job performance, they could still influence the algorithm's assessment of candidates.

Machine learning can revolutionize and automate various aspects, such as hiring. Businesses can effectively use machine learning to make predictions depending if it is designed and monitored carefully. As previously quoted, ""All said and done, AI-driven hiring tools are just as biased as the humans who train them."" (Section 3, Proposed Conceptual Model) we could infer that artificial intelligence is more objective and when correctly designed the machine learning model can reduce human bias in the hiring process. To reach the goal of objectivity, the model needs to have a diverse set of data. Although I agree that machine learning should make predictions, there should also be a level of auditing and testing of the algorithms in hand. Regular testing of the machine learning models for fairness and accuracy can help identify potential biases which could help discrimination. By implementing auditing, testing, and transparency, machine learning can provide a more efficient hiring process while improving fairness and equality compared to human biases.",
4612,1- Entirely written by me,"In July 2014, Christian Rudder, Founder and then-President of the dating site OK Cupid, published a post on the company blog entitled ""We experiment on human beings!""In the post, Rudder described three experiments the company had conducted on OK Cupid users, from which he drew conclusions about users' values, priorities, and suggestibility when searching for dates.

In this case study, your assignment is to analyze these instances of OK Cupid's experimental data collection from an ethical perspective. First, carefully read Rudder's post that describes each experiment and the results:[https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.htmlLinks to an external site.] (https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.html).

Then, follow these steps:

Step 1:Do some research about these experiments and the controversy that surrounded them (experiment #3 in particular). Focus your research on two areas:

* Findat least tworeputable media articles with more information about the controversy that surrounded the OK Cupid experiments, including the reaction from users and from experts.

* Findat least twoscholarly sources that address the issues at stake, either by analyzing this incident specifically, by theorizing the broader ethical issues around data collection by digital platforms, or both.



Step 2:Drawing on the sources you find AND material from class, write a short essay that reflects on OK Cupid's experiments and the broader questions they raise about ethical data collection. Your memo should be 800-1000 words (not including references). Make sure to cite all your sources!

First of all, in your essay, provide a brief description of OK Cupid's experiments and the controversy that surrounded. Then choose 1-2 questions below as a prompt for your paper and answer them with your own argument.Keep in mind that most of these questions do not have a ""correct""answer. Your memo will not be graded based on whether you take a particular position, but rather on the strength of the arguments you make and the reasoning behind them. Your paper also needs to incorporate course materials (key concepts, ideas, readings.. etc). Again, your grade will depend on how appropriately and rigorously you have drawn materials from class, rather than on the number of key concepts used.

* In your view, were each of OK Cupid's experiments ethical? Why or why not?

* How might the ethical theories we've covered in class, such as Act Utilitarianism and Kantian deontology, influence the way we think about these experiments? (For example, you could discuss the consequences- both harmful and beneficial- that might have resulted from these experiments for different actors, including OK Cupid users, social scientists who study dating, etc).

* If you had been running the research team at OK Cupid in 2014, would you have approved these experiments to be conducted? Why or why not?

* What changes (if any) could OK Cupid have made to make the experiments more ethical?

* OK Cupid's experiments adhered to their official Terms of Service, which informed users that their data might be used in research. How should that affect (or not) the way we assess the ethics of these experiments?

* As Rudder points out in his post, digital platforms conduct experiments on their users all the time. For example, Facebook has discovered through experiments that it can[boost voter turnoutLinks to an external site.] (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11401)and that a degree of ""[emotional contagionLinks to an external site.] (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/)""takes place on the platform.[Google ran 40 experiments to find the optimal shade of blueLinks to an external site.] (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/05/why-google-engineers-designers)with which to display its advertising links. Some of these experiments might strike us as deeply unethical, while others seem benign. Given that this kind of experimental data collection is widespread, what sort of general ethical rules and principles do you think should govern experiments on digital platforms?",Technology,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,48,Likely Human,37.93,1.91,0,"In recent years, online dating services have grown in popularity, and many users now rely on algorithmic matching to identify suitable companions. Although, these algorithms have increased concerns about user experimentation and data-gathering morality. An example is the series of tests of the dating website OK Cupid that ran on its customers in 2014. Ex-President of OK Cupid Christian Rudder wrote about three experiments the business has carried out on its users in a blog post titled ""We Experiment on Human Beings!"" One of the studies entailed changing the matchmaking algorithm. This experiment has generated a lot of discussion over the ethics of user experimentation without their consent and the ethics of data collection. The experiments conducted by OK Cupid on its users without their informed permission are unethical as they involve manipulating users' experiences, potentially impacting their emotions and relationships, and using their data for commercial purposes without their knowledge or consent.

Each of OK Cupid's experiments is considered unethical due to the lack of consent and manipulation of human emotions. Most of the experiments have something similar to the lack of consent from the user. Although some of the data might be public does not mean they are entitled to collect and use it for their purposes. For example, the New York Times state, ""The most important, and often least understood, concern is that even if someone knowingly shares a single piece of information, big data analysis can publicize and amplify it in a way the person never intended or agreed.""(Zimmer) This means that some individuals may not understand the future consequences of sharing information with the public, even if it is a single piece of information, as extensive data analysis can infer other details about the person. This could lead to problems such as targeting marketing, spam, or other privacy violations. Some may say that the data is public and they can use it, but using data that is explicitly consented to. From the class material, the idea of informed consent was not transparent in the experiments. The experiment is unethical because it did not obtain informed consent from users before examining the data and manipulating their behavior. Informed consent is one of the four ethical principles in research that ensures that participants are aware of the study and the risks involved. ""And once we evaluate that disruption in terms of the moral and political values of the users, as well as the broader goals of the context itself, we conclude that the impacts of the OkCupid study are not justifiable.""(Zimmer) We can infer that Zimmer means that the ethical values of the people involved, they concluded that the OkCupid study effects are not justifiable. The way how the study was conducted with the lack of communication and how they manipulated people's relationships was unethical as they did not explicitly give consent to the experiments.

OKCupid went through many unethical data manipulation and collection occurrences, which could have been solved by being more transparent. Firstly, OKCupid should have been more transparent about its data usage and policies to obtain consent from the user before conducting any experiments. ""If companies understand how much data is worth to consumers, they can offer commensurate value in return. Making the exchange transparent will be increasingly important in building trust.""(Morey). Research shows that if companies were more transparent in data collection, they would have more trust in the company, which could have avoided the situation. Another rule OkCupid could have implemented would be the guidelines such as the Belmont Report. The Belmont Report supports informed consent in class, as participants should agree before participating in an experiment. By OkCupid following the guidelines of the Belmont Report, it would have ensured the experiments would not violate the participants in an emotionally or physically damaging way. Finally, the idea of an ethical review board to oversee the experiments would have ensured the experiments were ethical. Although as technology progress ethical review boards may not be all that reliable due to the changing technologies every year. ""A recent study revealed that scientists who sit on university institutional review boards (IRBs) are not confident that they can keep pace with rapidly changing technologies used in research.""(Pagoto) Although ethical review boards may not be the final solution on solving how OkCupid solved their problem, the combination of transparency, ethical guidlines, and review boards could have made the experiments more ethical than experimenting on users with knowledge.",

As a student at Rutgers University, specializing in computer science, a volunteer firefighter, and a worker with local non-profits, I have been nurtured by my community's richness and diversity. After graduation, I plan to channel my unique confluence of experiences, skills, and values to make my community a better place. The crux of my strategy to better my community is founded on the understanding that technology, when leveraged correctly, can bridge gaps, bolster education, and enhance the quality of life. My generation and my parent's generation didn't have much chance with opportunities like the ones that are currently taking place in society. My primary goal is to make technology accessible and comprehensible to all members of my community, thereby democratizing its benefits.

My experiences volunteering at AI-learners, a summer education program for special children, will be particularly impactful in this endeavor. With AI-learners, I have been part of a transformative initiative that uses AI to create inclusive and adaptive learning environments for special needs children. After graduation, I aim to expand this initiative, leveraging my advanced computer science skills to refine the AI systems we use, ensuring that they are both more effective and more intuitive for students and educators alike. Moreover, I plan to hold regular workshops and seminars on digital literacy for various age groups. My intent is not only to teach the community how to use technology but also to inspire them to explore, innovate, and create with it. In this way, I can empower people to better navigate the digital age and make informed decisions about their own digital footprint.

While digital literacy is crucial, it is only one piece of the puzzle. In addition to my work in computer science, my role as a volunteer firefighter has imparted in me a profound understanding of safety, teamwork, and the human element in community service. The tenacity, resilience, and empathy I have gained from this experience are traits I aim to encourage within my community. By sharing my experiences and offering courses on basic safety and disaster management, I can help foster a community that is better prepared and more resilient in the face of adversity.

Lastly, my experiences working with local nonprofits have solidified my belief in the power of collective action. Post-graduation, I aim to initiate a community project that combines technology with community engagement. This project could take the form of a community-led platform for sharing resources, coordinating volunteering efforts, or even crowd-sourcing solutions to local issues. It's about providing the tools and platform for people to support each other in times of need and to collaborate in making their community a better place. I am under no illusion that these aspirations will be easy to achieve. I anticipate obstacles and challenges. But I am driven by the belief that every individual has the capacity to effect positive change within their community. After graduation, I intend to be a catalyst for that change, leveraging my unique skill set and experiences to foster an inclusive, resilient, and technologically empowered community.

Graduation is not the end of my journey but the start of a new chapter. It's an opportunity to give back to the community that has nurtured me and equipped me with the tools I need to succeed. I eagerly look forward to harnessing the power of computer science, the lessons I've learned from being a firefighter, and the spirit of collective action honed by my non-profit work, to make my community a better place for all its members.","The AI tool used was GPT-3.

In the 1930s, these two countries' ambitions to become global powers led to the establishment of dictatorships in Germany, Italy, and Japan, which eventually became known as the Axis Powers. The Allies, which included the US, Britain, and France, were also important powers in the war. During WWII, around 39 million people died in Europe. The majority of them were civilians. The war also led to widespread discrimination and persecution. In Western Europe during the Second World War, many people gave up their possessions and resorted to starvation. Many children witnessed the horrors of war. The end of imperialism and colonialism has been observed in Europe. In Italy and Germany, the dictatorships came to an end. In West Germany, the Soviet Union ruled. The United States, France, and Britain also ruled the country.

To my belief, the most important causes of WWII were the rise of Fascism and Nazism. In Italy, the Fascist party was established in 1922 under the leadership of Mussolini. Adolf Hitler then established his own dictatorship in 1933. Another cause was the Treaty of Versailles was one of the causes of the Second World War. It was established by the victors after Germany refused to sign it. Germany had protested against the treaty, but France had taken its revenge, and Germany was denied its colonies. The treaty had also imposed harsh conditions on the central powers. The last important factor that contributed to the conflict was the issue of national minorities. During the 1930s, US President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the concept of self-determination. However, his principles could not be implemented. This led to the growing insecurity among the minorities.

The most important consequences of WWII were deaths, around 12 million soldiers died, and about 25 million civilians were killed due to various reasons. In Nagasaki and Hiroshima, over a thousand people died. The loss of property was also caused by the war. It was estimated that the cost of the war was around $1 trillion. It destroyed various types of infrastructure such as roads and houses. The wave of democracy that followed the war also affected the world. After the war, people became aware of the injustices that they were experiencing and fought for their freedom. The end of colonialism also affected the world.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent in the field of graphic design in recent years. As with any new technology, there are both pros and cons to its adoption in this field. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the issue and discuss the potential implications of AI in graphic design. One of the main advantages of AI in graphic design is its ability to automate certain tasks. This can be incredibly useful for designers, who often have to deal with a large number of repetitive tasks such as resizing images or correcting colors. By using AI, these tasks can be automated, allowing designers to focus on more creative and challenging work. This can help to increase efficiency and productivity, ultimately leading to higher profits for design businesses. Another advantage of AI in graphic design is its ability to generate new ideas. AI algorithms can be trained on large datasets of design elements and patterns, allowing them to generate unique and creative designs that a human designer might not have thought of. This can be especially useful for designers who are working on a tight deadline or who are stuck in a creative rut.

It can be initiated by going from one state to another or it can be done through the external route. My parents did an external migration, from country to country. We, like most migrants, did it for economical reasons and for life improvement, first my grandparents and later on, my mother and father. Aside from providing social services, immigrants and migrants also contribute to the US economy by working jobs that Americans don't; while enriching cultural diversity.

I come from a long line of opportunists, from my grandparents to my parents, and my siblings and me. I do not have much information about my great-grandparents. The particular reason for this circumstance is my beliefs. My family has this belief that once a relative passes away, we get rid of everything that reminds us of him/her so we do not suffer. The only day we can talk about them is on November 1 and 2, originally known as (El d√≠a de Los Muertos / The day of the dead). My family is half Indigenous and half European/Spanish from my mother's side. My biological father's side, it's European, mainly from Germany. My great-grandparents never left Mexico.

According to a working paper by Ph.D. Victor Garcia and Ph.D. Laura Gonzalez Martinez, Mexican immigrants in the U.S. would only stay in certain regions such as Texas and Southern California. Though this was somehow true, when my mother came to New Jersey, there were very few Mexicans, mostly concentrated in New Brunswick, which was where she worked and met my father. Since the turn of the century, Mexican immigrants have been coming to the US from mostly the central areas of Mexico. Over the years, they have settled in the southwest, but a significant number also resided outside of this region. During the 1960s, when the Bracero Program was ended, their numbers started to shrink.

Thanks to my mother, I have the opportunity to study in the United States. Just like she and my stepfather did. My grandparents (from my mother's side) were young when the Bracero Program was active. This program allowed Mexicans to work in the States legally, but it was cheap labor. They took advantage of it and came to work. After the program ended in 1964, they stayed a few more years up to 1973, when they returned to Mexico. In their opinion, Mexico is home, and they had no reason to stay in the United States. They met in Mexico, and after my mother was born in 1979, my grandfather came again to work in Texas but passed away in a car accident. My grandmother was both mom and dad to my mom and her siblings. For almost a decade, they shared food, bed, and even clothing. When my mother described to me how she lived when she was a child, I cried. My mother started to show signs of high intelligence at the age of 10. But it wasn't until the Tequila Crisis in 1994 that my grandmother decided to get into debt and send my mother to the other side of the border to study. In 1995, when she turned 15, she arrived in New Jersey, where one of her uncles was waiting for her. Back then, no one helped her, not even her uncle. He said to my mother, ""If you don't work, there is no point in being in this country. This country will eat your time, your energy, your life. No one is going to give you a hand."" Words that never scared my mom.

When my mother turned 18, she moved to New York to pursue her education. She was able to enroll in a community college and eventually finish her degree at Yale University. However, she had a hard time finding a place to live, and her life was often characterized by poor living conditions. Many Americans think that migrants are bad people who come to the country to take advantage of the country. Although they may not be as bad as some people think, those who came here were not here to take advantage of the country. My mother came to New York to improve herself and help her family. Although she didn't choose to come to the US, my mother didn't have another option. She had a hard time adjusting to the country's harsh environment and constantly worked multiple jobs. During college breaks, she went back to New Jersey and work. Here both my biological parents met. My biological father recently arrived in NJ and couldn't speak and talk English, they met at a warehouse where my mother taught him English. She eventually graduated from Yale University with a degree in Economics. When both my parents were 20 years old, I was born, and three years later my brother was born.",

Works of art found in ancient burial places can shed light on particular cultures, periods, and values. Analyzing the Jade Elephant found in Fu Hao's tomb from 1200 BCE and the statue of Senusret III found in the funerary temple of King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep highlights the diverse ways Egyptian and East Asian cultures viewed the afterlife. Egyptian culture valued the reflection on the person's life, while East Asian Culture valued the peacefulness of the afterlife.

At first glance, the Senrust III statue looks like a typical Egyptian statue used to commemorate the fallen king's predecessor (Robertson 119). At a close look, though, the medium granodiorite is a rough gray material typically found in the region which symbolizes the monotony and somberness of the king. On the other hand, the medium used to create the Jade Elephant is a rare type of mineral called Jade which symbolizes goodness and prosperity in the Shang Dynasty (Robertson 152). While the Egyptians did not have symbolic meaning in the type of medium, they certainly had minute details carved into the statue that highlight more of the King's anguished expression: his arched eyebrows, severe face, and deep-set eyes. While the Jade Elephant shows peace and goodness, Senrust III's status is left as a reminder of the king's hardships. Drawing on the notion of seriousness versus peace, Egyptian culture showed that they place a high value on the remembrance of royalty; in contrast, the Shang Dynasty showed the importance of leaving the dead with a peaceful reminder. The Jade Elephant was placed in Fu Hao's tomb at the time of burial, and the tomb has not been touched or looted since excavation, meaning Fu Hao and her things have been left to rest in peace. On the other hand, the funerary temple of King Nebhhepetre Mentuhotep I has been re-entered just to place the statue of Senusret III. The fact that Fu Hao's tomb has not been visited shows that the Shang believed in a peaceful afterlife with no disturbances from the outside. However, the Statue of Senusret III was placed in the tomb of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep years after his burial, the predecessor of Senusret III, to leave a reminder and serve as a token of reflection. Thus, the Egyptians cared more about reflecting on royal values than the people from the Shang Dynasty.

Analyzing the Jade Elephant discovered in Fu Hao's tomb in 1200 BCE and the statue of Senrust III discovered in the funerary temple of King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep reveals the various afterlife beliefs held by East Asian and Egyptian societies. While East Asian society revered the tranquility of the afterlife, Egyptian culture promoted reflection on one's life. Scrutinizing art from other cultures can bring to light the commonalities and differences in how they view the Afterlife.

In American history, few decisions have resonated as profoundly as the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage in 2015. This landmark judgment, rendered in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, not only caused a seismic shift in the legal recognition of LGBTQ+ rights but also ignited a maelstrom of public discourse. This analysis delves deep into the intricate media coverage (images, keywords, metaphors, tone) of this Supreme Court's decision, dissecting the divergent lenses that nine news outlets took through which this event was portrayed. As Kitzinger puts it, ""tracking of the words, images, and metaphors used in the media reporting identifies clusters of competing rhetorical techniques,""and this analysis does that through identification of the diverse frames (Kitzenger, 2010). On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court issued a landmark 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry under the Constitution, legalizing gay marriage nationwide and drawing media reactions that reflected ideological divides, with news outlets casting either positive, negative, neutral/informational and entertainment framing of the decision.
Examining the negative framing of the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage by conservative outlets like Breitbart reveals distinct patterns in their coverage. These conservative sources consistently articulate dissenting opinions on the ruling, emphasizing their strong disagreement with the decision and its perceived implications- rather than just stating the facts. Their language is not only critical but also impassioned, reflecting the depth of their opposition.For instance, Breitbart published an article criticizing the Supreme Court's decision as a form of judicial overreach, asserting that it undermined the democratic process by overturning the views of millions of Americans. In this article, Breitbart stated, ""[f]ive Justices on the Supreme Court have overturned the votes of 50 million Americans and demanded that the American people walk away from millennia of history and the reality of human nature.In reaching a decision so lacking in foundation in the text of the Constitution, in our history, and in our traditions, the Court has done serious damage to its own legitimacy""(Ruse, 2015). This specific quote shows charged words such as ""damage""and questions the Court's legitimacy, highlighting concerns about the redefinition of marriage and The Constitution itself and ones that Kitzinger notes to look out which indicate ""framing.""It worries about erasing societal values and long-standing traditions rather than objectively reporting the news. Additionally, another example of such strong language and emotion can be found in Breitbart's characterization of the ruling as a ""crushing defeat for traditionalists,""which is the subheading of the article, emphasizing the Court's mandate of same-sex marriage as a constitutional right across the nation (Ruse, 2015). This choice of words amplifies the emotional intensity of the article, underscoring the outlet's opposition to the ruling and its impact on traditional values, thereby painting a negative frame.
On the other hand, there are supportive framings of the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage by outlets like NBC, PBS, and the New York Times, which paint a distinct narrative characterized by celebration and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights. Their language and tone are consistently celebratory, mirroring the enthusiasm and optimism generated by the ruling. For instance, NBC's coverage not only includes positive quotes from Obama but also highlights the White House's symbolic gesture, including a photo and an interactive link to an Instagram post captioned, ""[a]fter sundown on Friday, the White House celebrated the ruling by projecting rainbow-colored lights onto the house's exterior""(Williams & Abdullah, 2015). Unlike the negative framing, these outlets incorporate positive celebrations, amplifying the emotional resonance of the decision. Like Kitiznger notes, images also play a considerable role in framing, as this Instagram post casts a positive light on the decision. The New York Times frames it similarly- right at the beginning of the article, there is a multimedia presentation showcasing various reactions to the ruling, including images of same-sex couples getting married and vibrant pride flags, effectively capturing the positive spirit of the celebration (NY Times, 2015). Most readers will look at the beginning of a new outlet, and by placing the multimedia presentation in the beginning, this outlet successfully frames the news positively. Likewise, PBS captures the jubilation of the moment in the form of descriptive text, expressing, ""[g]ay rights supporters cheered, danced, and wept outside the court after the decision, which put an exclamation point on breathtaking changes in the nation's social norms""(Sherman, 2015). Through this vibrant narrative, PBS frames the news not merely as a Supreme Court decision but as a historical celebration, vividly portraying the profound societal shift that this ruling symbolized. Analyzing the tone as well as the media clips these outlets use provides valuable insights into their support for the ruling, emphasizing the positive framing that these outlets take on the news.","ChatGPT, word the essay better."

Civil unrest in Tunisia

The Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) has been at the forefront of a series of major protests against the President of Tunisia. The UGTT accuses the President of failing to address the country's economic and political problems and has called for his resignation. The protests have been peaceful, but tensions between the UGTT and the government are high. The government has taken a hardline stance against the UGTT, further fueling the protests.

The UGTT is one of the oldest and most powerful labor unions in the Arab world, with a history dating back to the 1920s when labor unions first emerged as a force for social change in the region. Back then, labor unions sought to improve working conditions and wages for workers in various industries. These labor unions played a crucial role in the fight for workers' rights, leading to the establishment of worker protections and labor laws still in place today. However, the labor movement has faced many challenges over the years. Governments have been known to crack down on unions and workers' rights, while anti-union sentiment has also been on the rise. Moreover, automation and outsourcing have further undermined the labor movement in recent years. Despite these challenges, labor unions continue to play a vital role in advocating for workers and fighting against exploitation and injustice. The UGTT's protests in Tunisia highlight the ongoing struggle of labor unions in the Arab world to protect workers' rights and improve their living conditions.

Some similar labor unions from the 1920s to the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) include the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the United States. The AFL was a federation of skilled craft unions that dominated the labor movement in the US in the 1920s, while the CIO was a federation of industrial unions that emerged in the 1930s and challenged the AFL's dominance. The UGTT, like these labor unions, seeks to improve working conditions and wages for workers in various industries and advocates for social justice and equality for all. Additionally, the UGTT has been distinguished from other labor federations in the Arab world for its long history and significant influence in advocating for workers' rights in Tunisia.

The UGTT's call for a new government that prioritizes the needs of the people is a reminder that labor unions are not just about workers' rights but also about social justice and equality for all. The UGTT has made it clear that the current government needs to prioritize the needs of the people and that a new government is needed for real change to occur. The UGTT's protests have also brought to light the issue of income inequality, which has been a significant problem in Tunisia. The UGTT has been advocating for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, which is crucial for addressing the root cause of the country's economic and political problems.

In conclusion, the UGTT's protests in Tunisia are a testament to the ongoing struggle of labor unions in the Arab world to protect workers' rights and improve their living conditions. The labor movement has faced many challenges over the years, but it plays a vital role in advocating for workers and fighting against exploitation and injustice. The UGTT's call for a new government that prioritizes the needs of the people is a reminder that labor unions are not just about workers' rights but also about social justice and equality for all.

5429,1- Entirely written by me,"What does ""Standpoint""refer to?

""Standpoint""refers to thesocial locationthat shapes how we know or understand the world. A critical approach to standpoint provides a complex picture of not only what our experiences are and where we ""stand""in the world-and what our perspective is from that vantage point- but how that relates to other positions of being and knowing within structures of power in a society.

One way of thinking about this, through the lens of feminist standpoint theory, is that we are experts of our own lives, and conversely, that we are not experts on the lives of others. Kimberl√© Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality helps us understand this further. To give a concrete example: while white or other non-Black women have privileged access to the perspective ofwomen, they do not have the experience of being Black, and therefore do not have privileged access to the perspective of Black women.

What impact do you think this might have on the way we move through the world, as individuals and in community? How does this standpoint shape our experience of the world?

Stagnant Society: One Step Forward, Two Steps Backwards

As a woman of color, I can identify with the feminist standpoint theory. While the traditional white woman may have had life easy for her, many other women of color and I faced various dilemmas that ultimately shaped us. If it were not for the tiny microaggressions, awkward occurrences, and society's ways, I would not be the woman I am today. While these occurrences disturbed some, they were eye-opening and reflective. Regarding intersectionality, I have fostered my unique experiences of discrimination and exclusion, be it race, religion, gender, or sexuality. There have been instances where I questioned my values as other people had ""issues""with them. While society is taking one step forward in removing racial discrimination, it is moving backward as it creates a new type of discrimination regarding sexual orientation. In short, society is stagnant as progress is by mitigating racial discrimination, but discrimination in other fields (such as sexuality) is created.

Regarding intersectionality, I have noticed that we are taking steps to accept the LGBTQ community and mitigate racial/ethnic discrimination; however, grand remnants of both issues still linger. Sharon Lee De La Cruz's comic ""Wild Seed""has artfully illustrated the various verses of being a non-heterosexual in modern society and incorporating other factors such as race and ethnicity. There were several layers, from receiving the judgment of members of the same community and members who are very close to youth regarding race and sexuality. I can relate to Cruz as I am a woman of color who does not adhere to the heteronormative society. I can relate to the dilemma Cruz had to progress through: many assume South Indians have darker skin tones and North Indians are lighter. Because I have a lighter skin tone, many people may assume I am a North Indian and make many assumptions. Some like to guess my parent's place of birth, that I am fluent in Hindi, etc. Just as Cruz was bothered by the hairdresser assuming her ethnicity, I, too, was annoyed by everyone's false assumptions about me as they stripped me of my true identity. Another topic Cruz artfully shed light on was the LGBTQ community: coming out is a personal experience. One would expect love and support from their shared community, but most people receive judgemental inferiority. It was nice of Cruz's mom to be completely open and content with her daughter's decisions. Some of my friends identify as a component of the LGBTQ community; however, they are scared to come out as they already know their immediate families and friends will not accept them. There are already divisions between races, and each race has an apparent division. How will we advance if we fail at homogenizing within our own community? It starts by rebuilding the notions each race shares within its community. We like to think that, now especially, we are very liberal and accepting, but are we really when we don't even acknowledge and provide comfort for our own peers? A new type of discrimination is being invented as people continue to reject and dismiss people's identities. I sometimes wonder if society is moving backward; however, we take two steps back every time we take a step forward.

Society is stagnant in advancing as it moves away from the obsolete notion of racial and sexual discrimination- however, small remnants of such concepts still exist. Despite society abolishing discrimination, it seems they are small pieces of racial discrimination in modern society linger. ""White culture""still deeply affects contemporary issues such as the wage gap. As Miya Carey and Pamela Walker mention in Reflections on Whiteness as Property, Harvard Law Review, 2020, ""whiteness mitigate risk through racial/spatial structures that sort probabilities and distribute access and opportunity""(Harris 6). The notion of witness acts as a shield for white people and effectively lowers the quality of people of color. Later on, the article mentions that African Americans are more financially disadvantaged than White Americans merely because they do not have the idea of ""whiteness""protecting them. This concept is highly accurate regarding other races as well. We encounter it all the time, but it is good that society makes programs that give economically disadvantaged people of color opportunities to achieve their fullest potential. In another part of the article, it is mentioned that modern society has formed a ""colorblind racial ideology""that ""has long asserted that the way forward to building support for change is to minimize the role of racial oppression""(Harris 10). Society is still propelling on the fruits of systematic slavery: various innovations and processes created by enslaved people are still used without acknowledging credit and work to the original inventor. We have fully gotten rid of the outdated notion of racial discrimination. However, reparations still need to be paid, and prolonging this act only sheds light on the leftover parts of discrimination. I have seen a similar situation: England thrives on global colonialism in numerous countries. Although colonialism is now abolished, several inventions and processes were not credited. It saddens me that proper reparations have not been paid, and in doing so, a tiny sliver of racial discrimination still lingers.

As a woman of color, I can identify with the feminist standpoint theory. While the typical white woman has it easy, many other women of color, like myself, have had to deal with various difficulties that have formed us. If it weren't for minor microaggressions, embarrassing incidents, and how society works, I would not be the woman I am today. While these occurrences were distressing, they also served as a wake-up call and an opportunity for introspection. Regarding intersectionality, I've had my own set of discrimination and oppression experiences, whether based on race, religion, gender, or sexuality. Because of ""issues"" with others, I've had to reassess my convictions on several occasions. After analyzing several articles and first-hand accounts about intersectionality, I wonder whether modern society is regressing; every stride forward is followed by two strides back.

While Nafisi emphasizes the ability of fiction to capture the essence of real-life experiences, Armstrong highlights the transformative power of mythos, symbolic stories that transcend logical reasoning yet resonate deeply with our understanding of the world. By delving into these perspectives, we can discern the unique truths that fiction imparts, truths that extend beyond the confines of mere reality and illuminate the depths of human experience.

Nafisi's assertion that fiction offers ""not so much reality but the epiphany of truth"" underscores the ability of fictional narratives to pierce through the superficial layers of daily life and reveal deeper truths about human nature. Through the lens of fictional characters and their experiences, we gain insights into the complexities of human emotions, the intricacies of relationships, and the universal struggles that transcend cultural and societal boundaries. Fiction, in this sense, serves as a mirror to the human soul, reflecting our hopes, fears, and aspirations with a clarity that often eludes us in the midst of our everyday lives.

Armstrong's concept of mythos, the symbolic storytelling embedded in religious rituals, further expands the notion of truth beyond mere reality. Mythos, though not bound by the constraints of logical reasoning, holds the power to transform our perceptions and connect us to a deeper understanding of the world. Through the symbolic language of myths, we encounter archetypal representations of human experiences, exploring themes of creation, destruction, redemption, and the eternal quest for meaning. While mythos may not provide literal answers to life's existential questions, it offers a framework for understanding our place in the universe and our interconnectedness with all of life.

The truths that fiction and mythos reveal are not tethered to the tangible world of facts and figures; they reside in the realm of emotions, experiences, and intangible connections. Fiction, through its evocative storytelling, can evoke empathy, foster understanding, and challenge our preconceived notions. Mythos, with its symbolic language, can inspire awe, deepen our sense of spirituality, and provide a framework for navigating life's complexities.

The relationship between fiction, mythos, and reality is not one of contradiction but rather of mutual illumination. Fiction, while not a direct replica of reality, can provide insights into the human condition that are as real, if not more so, than the events of our everyday lives. Mythos, while operating outside the realm of logic, can serve as a powerful tool for self-reflection and connection to something larger than ourselves. Together, fiction and mythos offer a tapestry of truths that enrich our understanding of the world and our place within it.

In conclusion, the truths that fiction and mythos impart extend beyond the confines of mere reality, offering insights into the depths of human experience and the interconnectedness of all existence. Through the evocative storytelling of fiction and the symbolic language of mythos, we gain access to profound truths about human emotions, relationships, and the enduring quest for meaning. These truths, while not bound by the limitations of logic and fact, hold the power to transform our perceptions, foster empathy, and inspire a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. Fiction and mythos, in this sense, serve as guides, illuminating the path towards a more authentic and meaningful existence.","google bard:

Two different passages can have different interpretations of fiction. Karen Armstrong's Homo Religiosus dives into the history of premodern religion and serves as a defense for the concept of religion as a whole given that modern science disproves most of the myths and dogma that are presented by religion. By exploring the history and cultural effects of religions like Hinduism and Buddhism on areas that predominantly practiced them, Armstrong noted that they all eventually centered around the alluding mystery of the human soul and life itself. In other words, ""Being"". Azar Nafisi's Reading Lolita in Tehran is quite different. It describes her experiences leading a rebel group of women who rejected the ideas of the totalitarian fundamentalist Islamic Republic of Iran where they happened to reside in. As the individuality of women was stripped away through mandated clothing and strict censorship laws, these women came together in Nafisi's apartment to regain their autonomy by using it as a safe space to discuss literature and the lessons they could derive from them. In essence, they were after the truths that could only come from journeys of fiction. Fiction's unique power to transcend reality helps us grapple with unexplainable nonlogical constants of life, embark on journeys of self-discovery for our values, and allow for a frame of mind that frees human consciousness from the shackles of the observable world.
  Fiction opens the door to another universe fundamentally different from our own, yet by understanding these worlds, fiction allows us to understand otherwise unexplainable notions about our world. For instance, Armstrong discusses the dilemma that faced the respectful hunter tribes in the premodern era: animals must be killed to be eaten. This unshakable fact of life was an uncomfortable one for these tribes. This is where fiction steps in. ""One of the functions of ritual are to evoke an anxiety in such a way that the community is forced to conform and control it. From the very beginning, it seems, religious life was rooted in acknowledgment of the tragic fact that life depends upon the destruction of other creatures""(Armstrong 4). By confiding in fiction, the ritual stories about the Animal King and the idea of a pact being created between animals and mankind increased the respect between and for the land and animals that inhabited it. By exploring moral dilemmas like these through fiction, these premodern societies had to search hard to find the truth about why the world was like this, eventually leading to them coming to terms with the reality of their world. Even though there is a clear distinction between what's true and what is fiction, the latter was able to have a profound impact on the way these people saw the former. What was once unexplainable with typical human logic and reasoning became widely understood after engaging with fiction as a form of escapism from the constraints of reality-driven logic. Nafisi's passage carries a similar message. Rather than premodern societies, she discusses modern-day life under the totalitarian Iranian regime. In describing the circumstances she and her companions found themselves in, she wrote that ""Those of us living in the Islamic Republic of Iran grasped both the tragedy and absurdity of the cruelty to which we were subjected. ‚Ä¶ [Nabokov's novels] are filled with mistrust of what we call everyday reality, an acute sense of that reality's fickleness and frailty""(Nafisi 291). While life under totalitarianism might feel like an irreconcilable constant in one's life, these women were able to use fiction to better understand the constraints and constants present in their lives: mistrust, corruption, etc mean outside of their totalitarian vacuum.
  While physically separated from the stories we engage with, understanding the ideas presented in fiction can lead to important introspection and the discovery of our values, leading us on a path towards true individualism. Armstrong introduces the idea of premodern self-discovery by describing the initiation process that the boys of nomadic hunting tribes had to undergo to progress to adulthood. These boys were beaten, made to believe that monsters were after them, and fed a variety of other lies. Armstrong notes that: ""Psychologists tell us that the terror of such an experience causes regressive disorganization of the personality that, if skillfully handled, can lead to a constructive reorganization of that young man's powers. He has faced death, come out the other side, and is now psychologically prepared to risk his life for his people""(Armstrong 5). While in modern society we're often left to ourselves to figure out who we are, there was no time for this in these premodern societies due to the immediate need for hunters and productive members of society. Thus, the leaders of these tribes relied on fiction. By telling stories and manipulating experiences, the tribe leaders were able to accelerate the self-introspection and discovery period. In this case, fiction forced these boys to look deeper and think about their priorities and values. This type of simulated experience is a type of fiction that the leader used to teach the next generations about reality. Without its use, the boring reality would often not adequately prepare the young for the ""real world"". Nafisi's text describes a far less brutal type of fiction: literature. It is in the stories the group reads where the true questioning of their reality under the censorship of the totalitarian Iranian regime starts. ""Perhaps one way of finding out the truth was to do what we did: to try to imaginatively articulate these two worlds and, through that process, give shape to our vision and identity""(Nafisi 293). Nafisi and her group can discover the truth about their reality by turning to fiction and analyzing and immersing themselves in it. Though they can't leave their nation frequently to discover the world for themselves, fiction can provide an outlet for them to do so. Through the power of fiction, these women cannot only understand their reality but think about themselves and their values and identity in the face of a world that wants to squash the individuality that women possess, further emboldening their power even in oppressive environments.
  While the real world is infinite, human consciousness is still shackled by the idea of what is realistic. Fiction, on the contrary, serves to liberate one from the real world and pushes the human mind to its limits. Armstrong discusses the value of ritual and how the yogis in India were able to harness the power of ritual to gain a different perspective on the world which is impossible to reach through logical reasoning. ""The Upanishadic sages did not ask their disciples to ""believe"" this but put them through an initiation whereby they discovered it for themselves in a series of spiritual exercises that made them look at the world differently. This practically acquired knowledge brought with it a joyous liberation from fear and anxiety""(Armstrong 13). In this case, the fiction is the ritual itself. There is no practical reason to partake in a ritual of any kind, there is absolutely no logical outcome to controlling your breathing in novel ways. However, by pushing oneself past these mental limiters, the yogis saw that a different type of understanding could be awakened. This appreciation for the nuances of life and the concept of ""Being""is the outcome that the yogis were after. By partaking in ritual and throwing logical reasoning aside for deeper introspections with fiction, these disciples were able to untie their minds from reality to even comprehend ""Being"". Nafisi's text references a similar idea in the exploration of painting. Nafisi noticed that one of her painting friends had gone from hyperrealistic pieces to highly abstracted works. ""I asked about [my painter friend's] progress from modern realism to abstraction. Reality has become so intolerable, she said, so bleak, that all I can paint now are the colors of my dreams.""‚Ä¶ ""I liked that. How many people get a chance to paint the colors of their dreams?""(Nafisi 283). Nafisi's painting friend's fiction is found in her transition to abstraction. Once painting discarded women's photos and empty streets, she moved on to all sorts of colors and different rebellious designs that mean absolutely nothing to the layperson. However, by embracing this abstraction, or fiction, Nafisi had unshackled her mind from the bounds of reality. She had been able to express herself in ways that could not even be comprehensible without the spectator also throwing away their expectation of reality. Herein lies the value of fiction: the yogis and disciples were able to discover the fundamental energy that runs through oneself, while Nafisi's painter friend was able to tap into her mind and paint the colors of her dreams.
  The texts of Armstrong and Nafisi couldn't appear any more different on the surface. One discusses the history of religion, while the other depicts a group of students learning about their world through discussing literature. However, both of these texts have a central player: fiction, and the way it connects to reality. Fiction can help the people in these texts grapple with the unshakable realities of their worlds, helps these people find themselves and their values, and allows the human mind to flourish without restriction. From confiding with the pact with the Animal King to reading Nabokov's novels and looking at the juxtaposition between two distinct worlds, fiction has the power to transcend the page or the spoken word and have an observable impact on the very reality fiction it attempts to both escape from and build a bridge towards.",
8609,4- AI-generated,"Talk about an instance where ideas discussed in Daniel Gilbert's ""Immune to Reality"" pertain to your own life.",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,95,Likely AI,89,0.08,99.8,"In Daniel Gilbert's enlightening book ""Immune to Reality,"" he delves into the fascinating world of human psychology, exploring the intricate mechanisms that shape our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. One of the central themes of the book is the concept of the psychological immune system, a metaphorical construct that refers to our brain's innate tendency to shield us from emotional distress and maintain a positive self-image. While this defense mechanism serves a valuable purpose in protecting our mental well-being, it can also lead to cognitive biases and misperceptions of reality.

As I reflect on my own life experiences, I find myself drawn to several instances where the ideas discussed in ""Immune to Reality"" resonate deeply with my personal journey. One such instance relates to the concept of ""availability heuristic,"" a cognitive bias that leads us to overestimate the likelihood of events based on their ease of recall. This bias often manifests in our tendency to overestimate the risk of rare events, such as plane crashes or terrorist attacks, while underestimating the prevalence of more common, but less visible, events, such as heart disease or accidental falls.

I vividly recall an instance where I found myself falling prey to the availability heuristic. During a particularly stressful period in my life, I experienced a series of minor setbacks and misfortunes. These events, although relatively insignificant in the grand scheme of things, became disproportionately prominent in my thoughts due to their recency and emotional salience. As a result, I began to develop an exaggerated perception of my vulnerability to misfortune, overestimating the likelihood of future negative events.

This skewed perception led to a heightened state of anxiety and a sense of helplessness. I found myself avoiding activities that I once enjoyed, fearing that they would inevitably lead to disappointment or failure. The grip of the availability heuristic had distorted my rational thinking, clouding my judgment and hindering my ability to make sound decisions.

Fortunately, as I became more aware of the psychological immune system and its potential for bias, I was able to challenge my distorted perceptions and adopt a more objective perspective. I recognized that my recent setbacks, while unpleasant, were not indicative of an ongoing pattern of misfortune. I also acknowledged that my focus on these negative events had blinded me to the many positive aspects of my life.

With this newfound awareness, I began to gradually reengage in activities that I had once avoided. I consciously sought out experiences that brought me joy and fulfillment, reminding myself of my resilience and ability to overcome challenges. As I shifted my focus towards gratitude and positivity, my anxiety dissipated, and my sense of self-efficacy returned.

This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing and understanding the biases that can cloud our perceptions of reality. The psychological immune system, while often beneficial, can lead us astray if we allow it to operate unchecked. By critically examining our thoughts and feelings, we can identify and challenge these biases, fostering a more accurate and balanced understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

Another concept from ""Immune to Reality"" that resonates with my life experiences is the idea of ""mental projection."" This refers to our tendency to assume that our current thoughts, feelings, and preferences will persist indefinitely. We often project these internal states onto the future, believing that we will continue to feel and behave the way we do now, regardless of changing circumstances.

This tendency for mental projection has influenced my own decisions and behaviors in various ways. For instance, when faced with difficult or uncertain situations, I have often found myself making decisions based on my current emotional state, rather than considering the potential long-term consequences. This impulsive approach has sometimes led to regrettable outcomes.

Recognizing the limitations of mental projection has been crucial in developing a more mindful and future-oriented approach to decision-making. I have learned to acknowledge that my current emotional state, while valid, may not accurately reflect my preferences and priorities in the future. By considering a wider range of potential outcomes and evaluating my decisions from a more objective standpoint, I have been able to make more informed and sustainable choices.

Overall, the insights gained from Daniel Gilbert's ""Immune to Reality"" have profoundly influenced my understanding of human psychology and its impact on our lives. By recognizing and addressing the biases and limitations of our mental processes, we can cultivate a more accurate and nuanced perception of ourselves and the world around us. This newfound awareness empowers us to make informed decisions, navigate challenges with greater resilience, and foster a deeper sense of self-understanding.","Google Bard:

In the early days of the outbreak, there was a great deal of uncertainty and fear surrounding the virus and its potential impact on our lives. Many of us were caught off guard by the sudden crisis and struggled to make sense of the rapidly changing information coming our way. We were blasted by news reports over and over from different sides that were equally uninformed about the pandemic, while the news coming from the hospital floor was shocking: depicting mass graves and ICUs filled to the brim. We were scared and stuck at home, fearing for our lives. Interestingly, things took a big turn after the pandemic slowed down.

During the early days of the pandemic, many of us were terrified to leave the safety of our homes. We were afraid of contracting the virus, spreading it to others, and of the potential consequences of our actions. We hated being cooped up inside and longed for the freedom and normalcy of life before the pandemic. But as time went on, our perspective began to shift. We started to appreciate the benefits of staying home - the extra time with our families, the lack of commuting and traffic, and the opportunity to slow down and reflect. We began to look back on the pandemic with a sense of nostalgia, remembering the simpler, quieter days with longing. This shift in perspective can be explained, in part, by our tendency to ""fact-cook."" That is, we selectively interpret and manipulate information to reinforce our beliefs and biases. Daniel Gilbert explains in his book Immune to Reality, ""When we cook facts, we are often unaware of why we are doing it, and this turns out to be a good thing"" (Gilbert 143). By unconsciously filtering out negative information and highlighting the positive, we can generate a more positive view of the world around us. In the case of the pandemic, this means that we are more likely to remember the good parts of staying home - the extra time with our loved ones, the reduction in stress and pollution - and to overlook the bad details - the isolation, the boredom, the loss of income and opportunities. This allows us to look back on the pandemic with nostalgia, even though it was challenging.

While it's easy to make this generalization for society, I was curious to see how people in my own life felt about the pandemic, both in the past and present. A compelling archive was messages from the app ""Discord."" While I remember hating quarantine at the time, I made an effort to look back and understand what the attitudes surrounding the lockdowns were at the time. My suspicions were immediately confirmed. While there was some initial excitement about not having much school in March and April of 2020, it eventually became a hassle to live this way. Groceries were a big concern, as I was walking the dog and meeting up with friends. While it seems silly now, no vaccine, direction, or information could realistically be relied upon. Even though we were glad to be able to play Minecraft all day without consequence, there was still an element of fear lurking in the background.

Interestingly, I've noticed that the conversation about ""the covid times"" has completely changed. While we're in college now, and it's normal to feel nostalgic about when we were 15, this period of time keeps getting brought up over and over again. I took it upon myself to ask my friends why this was. For many of my friends, this was their first experience with being chronically online, along with like-minded people. Some friends have hilarious and cringeworthy stories about e-dating endeavors gone wrong. Other friends claimed they sorely missed the time they could loaf around the house without consequence. Lastly and most shockingly, I noticed that the sudden isolation during one's formative years of development allowed their socially awkward self to ignore their shortcomings completely. These friends desperately long for another time when we're all cooped up at home. Some have even joked that they wish covid would just come back stronger. While tongue-in-cheek, I was horrified that this was even a consideration. I remember all the fear and doubt everyone was going through at the time. When reading Gilbert, we learned about fact-cooking, and this was the first thing I thought of. From the looks of it, we were pinpointing and cherry-picking the positives of our experiences during what is now a bygone era. We've thrown out the negatives so we don't have to relive the trauma.

Being about two and a half years removed from the pandemic, I've realized that going from the unknown to the known is extremely painful and uncomfortable. However, due to the effects of fact-cooking and the works of the emotional immune system, we will soon, without fail, be looking back at the unknown for all the good it had to offer and none of the bad. I'm grateful for my experiences during this class, since they made me think deeper into the way we interact with the world, not just physically, but also emotionally. I wonder what I'll look back on fondly about my first semester when I'm further removed.",

As I pack up all my belongings I exit the computer lab and begin to lock the door, however in the distance I hear, ""Wait! Don't lock the door!"". I turn around frightened as I remember the past couple rutgers emails were about the increase in crimes.

Try again tomorrow and have a good day.""I would then leave and ignore however much they complain and beg as it's their fault for wanting to do this last minute.

Would gender make a difference in my choice of letting them in?

I know a lot of people would allow the girl in and not the boy as they are both strangers and it's 12 a.m. The reason they would allow the girl in and not a boy is simply due to the stereotype that girls are a lot more safer and trustworthy compared to boys. Boys are a lot more dangerous especially if it's 12 a.m in the pitch dark. I think another reason people would allow the girl and not the boy isn't just due to gender but also due to looks as well. If the girl was a young girl or simply a nice attractive girl more people would be inclined to open it for her since she even seems safe. However is the girl had lots of tattoos all over and looked super creepy even though she is a girl I doubt people will let her in. On the other hand if the boy looked super young and attractive he would also be deemed safe and people would still let the guy in even though the stereotype of a guy is ""dangerous""and ""unsafe"". If the guy was a big older guy with tattoos all over his face people would probably just run away and be scared and now the stereotype of ""dangerous""and ""unsafe""would be in effect. According to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, ""men who harbor more harmful attitudes about masculinity - including beliefs about aggression and homophobia - also tend toward bullying, sexual harassment, depression and suicidal thoughts.""(Hare, Par. 1). This information simply proves why people see men more of a threat then women all due to masculinity. If the boy looks more like a man and less of a boy he is deemed more masculine which means he is more dangerous. For me personally no matter the gender I still wouldn't let them in as it's still closed at 12 a.m and I would want to go home. However if the person I was talking to was a girl I would feel a lot more comfortable and safe then if it was a boy.

Would race change my decision on letting them in?

I know for a lot of people race is just as big of an importance as gender is when it comes to judging people. Stereotypically all types of race have some sort of ""dangerous"", ""unlawful target""on its back. According to ""American Psychological Association the people they studied saw different races as, ""terrorists (Middle Eastern, Muslim male immigrants); child molesters (White, middle-aged married men); drug dealers (uneducated, young African-American men). This shows that no matter the race each race has some type of negative fear on its back. I understand that if I was a girl and the person asking me to open the door was a white older guy I would be terrified and feel more unsafe. However me being a guy I would feel the least scared if it was a white older guy as I'm a guy. I would be more scared if the person was african american as they could be a drug dealer and drug dealing involves gangs. I would also be more scared if the person was from the middle east as they could be a terrorist plotting something scary and now I would have to get involved. However in my opinion gender holds a higher importance when it comes to letting someone in or not at 12 a.m. In my opinion if you were to compare the scenario with an african american girl who could be a ""potential drug dealer""vs a muslim guy the muslim guy would still be more scary due to him being a guy and having the strength and masculinity makes him more of a scary threat vs race. In the end no matter the race I still wouldn't let them in as it's still closed at 12 a.m and I would want to go home. However if the person was hispanic I may be a bit hesitant simply because I myself am hispanic so I feel the need to help my people however in the end I still wouldn't let anyone in.

Summary

In conclusion no matter the gender or race I still wouldn't let the person go into the lab as it's still closed at 12 a.m and I would want to go home. Even if the person is a girl, and girls are deemed safer than guys I still would not let the girls in. No matter the race, hispanic, white, black, or asian I still wouldn't let them in despite all the stereotypes they all have. For me personally the most important thing in whether I choose to let a stranger in all depends on the situation on hand. The fact that they want to go to the computer lab at 12 a.m to finish an assignment that is due the next day is still very strange to me. Like why do they have to go this very second? They could simply go tomorrow early morning and start to work on it. I would have to really examine their nonverbal communication by looking at their facial expressions and eye contact when they are talking to me. If they looked scared and nervous I can tell they are telling the truth. I would also look for body movement if they are showing signs of aggression and power then I would feel scared and probably let them in just to stay safe. In conclusion I value the power of nonverbal communication over stereotypes when it comes to allowing the person to enter the lab.",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,D,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human,34.14,0.02,0,"

923,"3- Partly written by me, partly by AI","It has been long known in art history for many ancient societies to bury significant objects, such as artworks, alongside important dead people during those times. For example, some common societies include ancient Egypt, East Asian, South American, and Mesoamerican art. They typically buried these artworks for multiple reasons, such as the remembrance of the person buried. According to Jean Robertson and other co-writers of the textbook,'The History of Art: A Global View', ""Some of the displays reflect loving memories of the deceased official's life and accomplishments, and may also be hopeful images of a future prosperous life after death""(93). In other words, these objects were buried with these people in order to enhance their legacy by placing them next to a piece of artwork that represented their importance to future civilizations. Another reason these ancient societies buried these objects was to support the afterlife. Many civilizations believed in the afterlife, the idea that there was some type of life that existed beyond life given by God. As a result, they believed that burying the dead with useful objects such as weapons or expensive jewelry was going to help them live and prosper in the afterlife. In fact, these two main reasons were why the famous ancient Egypt and East Asia buried artworks down below such as the Asian Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from the tomb of Fu Hao and Egyptian Dagger and sheath from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Even though they had similar beliefs of burying the dead with objects, they also had other similar and different cultures regarding burying the dead and the concept of afterlife.

The Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from East Asia and the Dagger and sheath from Egypt were both some type of weapons attached with a blade. On one hand, the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from the tomb of Fu Hao was made up of bronze with a wooden handle. On the other hand, the Dagger and sheath from the tomb of Tutankhamun had a gold sheath, decorated with a feather pattern. The dagger's blade was made up of iron and nickel, a material very rare back then. In fact, scientists believe the medium of the dagger came from a meteorite. In other words, same purpose but different materials. Additionally, Fu Hao was buried with numerous bronze weapons, as she was a warrior during those times. It signified her important role and position in society and how she made an impact saving lives. Unlike Hao, King Tutankhamun was buried with the precious dagger as he was instead the king and ruler of ancient Egypt. It was said that his tomb was filled with jewelry and weapons from all different sorts of materials. Because both of these tombs contained people of high significance during those times, the placement of these artworks help future civilizations understand their legacy and significance of them and their culture.

Overall, the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from East Asia and the Dagger and sheath from Egypt both had significance of being buried. They both represented the people they were buried with and showed some type of status of Fu Hao and King Tutankhamun. And in terms of afterlife, both these buried weapons would be useful for them. Both bladed weapons were made up of rare materials such as bronze, iron, and nickel that ensured success in the afterlife. Additionally, because of these objects, people today are able to understand life during those types. For example, the art history textbook mentions about the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade and how, ""The wood has long since disintegrated, but the blade remains, evidence of the advanced state of bronze technology in the Shang dynasty""(153). Historians today know that because of all that bronze weaponry found in Fu Hao's tomb, the Shang dynasty was bursting with that metal.

In fact, these two main reasons were why the famous ancient Egypt and East Asia buried artworks down below such as the Asian Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from the tomb of Fu Hao and Egyptian Dagger and sheath from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Even though they had similar beliefs of burying the dead with objects, they also had other similar and different cultures regarding burying the dead and the concept of afterlife.

The Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from East Asia and the Dagger and sheath from Egypt were both some type of weapons attached with a blade. On one hand, the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from the tomb of Fu Hao was made up of bronze with a wooden handle. On the other hand, the Dagger and sheath from the tomb of Tutankhamun had a gold sheath, decorated with a feather pattern. The dagger's blade was made up of iron and nickel, a material very rare back then. In fact, scientists believe the medium of the dagger came from a meteorite. In other words, same purpose but different materials. Additionally, Fu Hao was buried with numerous bronze weapons, as she was a warrior during those times. It signified her important role and position in society and how she made an impact saving lives. Unlike Hao, King Tutankhamun was buried with the precious dagger as he was instead the king and ruler of ancient Egypt. It was said that his tomb was filled with jewelry and weapons from all different sorts of materials. Because both of these tombs contained people of high significance during those times, the placement of these artworks help future civilizations understand their legacy and significance of them and their culture.

Overall, the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade from East Asia and the Dagger and sheath from Egypt both had significance of being buried. They both represented the people they were buried with and showed some type of status of Fu Hao and King Tutankhamun. And in terms of afterlife, both these buried weapons would be useful for them. Both bladed weapons were made up of rare materials such as bronze, iron, and nickel that ensured success in the afterlife. Additionally, because of these objects, people today are able to understand life during those types. For example, the art history textbook mentions about the Bronze Ceremonial Ax Blade and how, ""The wood has long since disintegrated, but the blade remains, evidence of the advanced state of bronze technology in the Shang dynasty""(153). Historians today know that because of all that bronze weaponry found in Fu Hao's tomb, the Shang dynasty was bursting with that metal. In other words, today people are able to get some type of insight into these ancient societies and cultures.",Write me essay written by a student style

5709,1- Entirely written by me,"India vs United States' Equality

Fairly equal: when someone thinks about the United States, this is the first word that typically comes up in their head when comparing the United States' economy to other countries. The United States is known for being the land of opportunity and the place where making money is comparatively easier than other developed and undeveloped countries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, the current unemployment rate of the United States is 3.8%. This rate just shows how the number of people unemployed in the country is pretty low. Not only low unemployment rates, one might also think that the US also has low inequality rates. One of the United States' motto is ""equal opportunity""so it makes perfect sense if people assume the country's wealth is also equal among the people. However, that is far from the truth. As perfectly said by John F. Kennedy, ""All of us do not have equal talent, but all of us should have an equal opportunity to develop our talent""(Kennedy). In other words, just because the country provides numerous opportunities to its people, does not mean that its people are all equally successful due to differences in ""talent""and skill levels. For example, if you compare the US with the country India, one would immediately jump to conclusions and say that India is not a fairly equal country, as there are many rich higher class people living in fancy apartments while thousands of people are living and barely surviving on the rural streets. It also makes sense for people to assume that as the unemployment rate in India is 7.45%. And if one compares the unemployment rates 3.8% with 7.45% and look at the conditions of India's people versus America, they would conclude that the United States has lesser inequality in general. However, this assumption is not true one bit. Although it seems like India might have more inequality than the United States due its unemployment rates and conditions, the United States in fact has more inequality than India for numerous reasons and influences.

There have been many factors that influenced the United States' income inequality throughout the years. In 1774, according to historians, incomes were more equally distributed in America than in any other country. Back then, the richest 1% had only 8.5% of the country's total income, whereas today almost 20% of the total income accrues to the top 1%. Not only that but the gini coefficient changed from being way lesser than 50% to today being 41.95. Just to keep note, the higher the gini coefficient is to 100%, the higher the income inequality is. This clearly shows that there had to be many factors that changed the percentage of total income share by over 10% and gini coefficient by a significant amount. One factor was the increase in immigration. Immigration had accounted for a large proportion of population growth in the United States. Every immigrant who worked potentially had an impact on the nation's total income; its income per capita; and its distribution of income. In other words, more people in a country equals more people working and boosting the nation's economy through more jobs.

Additionally, another heavy factor that increased the nation's wealth was trade. After France declared war on England, Spain, and Holland in 1792, England and France were both desperate to trade for American goods. And as a result of trading with both sides fighting in the war, the U.S. took over most of the shipping trade. In fact, between 1795 and 1800, shipments of sugar from the Caribbean to Europe on American ships doubled, while American reexport of European goods to Latin American septuples. This whole trading system then increased the wealth of the country. In addition to trade, technological advances are also what caused the country to gain more money. For example, before 1790, the U.S. exported very little cotton, as it was too expensive to produce. since removing the seeds from the lint was time-consuming. However, in 1794, Eli Whitney patented the cotton gin, which made cotton production suddenly very profitable. Cotton then became the most valuable crop in the U.S., thus increasing trade value. Another significant innovation the United States developed was the world's first steamboat. The steamboat made the transportation of goods within the U.S. become faster, and trade expanded. And as a result, by 1860, the U.S. per capita income relative to England's was even higher than in 1700. Despite immigration, and all the advances in technological inventions and trade, a relatively small proportion of people earned large amounts of money in finance and manufacturing, as the income between the urban and rural residents and north and south states became more unequal.

Before industrialization, agriculture was the main source of income. In the United States, at least, this meant a relatively equal income distribution. And after industrialization, people moved to cities (population centers) for more economic opportunity. However, it is commonly known that cities have more unequally distributed income than rural areas as the industry involves people at varying levels of the production hierarchy, with very different incomes. As more of a country's total income comes from industry/cities, the unequal distribution of income within cities matters more and more to total inequality than the more equal distribution of income in rural areas. And as result, the overall distribution of income becomes more unequal. On top of that, in 1929, when the stock market crashed and the Great Depression happened, it caused a huge economic contraction or decline in per capita income. This then increased inequality, as it had greater negative effects on workers with low incomes as compared to ones with higher ones. And in addition to the Great Depression, another similar event to that was the Great Recession, where a sharp decline in economic activity during the late 2000s occurred. As shown in Figure 1, according to the Pew Research Statistics Center, the highest fifth and top 5% 's change in wealth was positive as compared to the lower classes(second, third, and fourth). In other words, ""The richest families are the only group to have gained wealth since the Great Recession""(). And this is because typically during recessions, low-income workers disproportionately lose their jobs and high-income workers keep theirs due to skill and necessity. Overall, these factors are what caused the United States' income inequality to increase. Not only have these economical factors influenced the country's unequal distribution of wealth, but the government and their political decisions also factor into the country's inequality levels. On top of that, since the government consists of two parties: Democrats and Republicans, the income inequality changes depending on which party is running the country at that moment. Larry Bartel, the writer of Unequal Distribution, points out that ""inequality increased under Republican presidents and decreased or held constant under Democratic presidents. This is because incomes of the bottom 80 percent of families tended to grow more rapidly under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones""(Kenworthy). This just shows how parties influence the level of inequality in the country and are important to keep in mind when observing the factors. However, the only drawback to the results and conclusions of Bartel's work is that it only can be concluded until 2003. So it can't be fully concluded that income inequality changes as per who's running, but it is still important to keep in mind. Even today, people always say that Republicans are good for businesses, especially for developed and rich companies or people, whereas the Democrats are for the people, mainly middle to lower class, as their platform ensures equality and provides benefits to those kinds of people. Overall, as a result of these economical and political changes in the country, the distribution of wealth became unbalanced as compared to colonial America.

After understanding the United States' years of changing from fairly equal to unequal, which is somewhat shocking as nobody would have expected the ""great'' America to have flaws financially, one can compare it to another country like India and see exactly how unequal the United States is. According to Statista, a website that provides credible data on the global economy, India's gini coefficient is currently 35.91%. To recall again, the U.S. 's gini was 41.95%, which means India has lesser income inequality than the US, as the value is lower. This is very surprising as one would think India would be more unequal than America. There may be many factors that influenced India to have income inequality, but not as low as the US, which needs to be acknowledged in this paper.

Before India was independent, India was under British colonial rule in 1858, where the top 10% income share was around 50% and income inequality was very high. And after India got its independence from Britain, the share reduced to 35-40%. According to Economic Times, ""Owing to poor post-Independence economic conditions‚Ä¶ the top 1% has largely benefited from these economic reforms [and reduction in share] , the growth among low and middle-income groups has been relatively slow and poverty persists""(Economic Times). In other words, even though after post-independence India became slightly less unequal in terms of income, it wasn't enough to reduce it significantly and prevent the rich from getting richer and the poor still poor. In addition to that, another huge main factor that can explain India's income inequality is poverty. According to the World Poverty Clock in 2021, ""roughly 6% or 86,799,498 (86.8 million) of the population [India]are living in poverty‚Äù(The Global Statistics). On the other hand, according to Statista, ""around 15 million adults [upper class] who had a personal wealth valued between 100,000 and one million U.S. dollars""and higher. (Statista). The difference between people in poverty and people making over 100K to over million dollars is crazy high. This just shows why the income inequality is so high in India. There are people living on the streets not able to afford basic necessities, while others are living in lavish houses and buying just anything they desire. One may say that the U.S. also has poverty, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau, ""In 2020, there were 37.2 million people in poverty""(Consensus Bureau). Even though this number is quite high, when compared to India's 86 million being in poverty, it's nothing. In addition to poverty, India has high inequality due to lesser job opportunities and higher unemployment rates. Because the population is so large, the number of people is not proportionate to the number of jobs available, which is why so many Indians move abroad to get better and more opportunities. As mentioned above, the US has many immigrants coming to fill in the empty jobs waiting for them, which is not the same for India. India has more people, less jobs, while the U.S. has less people, more jobs. And on top of that, because technology is getting more advanced, there are fewer low-skilled jobs in India, leaving only the educated and highly- skilled people to keep their jobs. Speaking of education, the biggest difference between India and the US is the education level. According to Nation Master, a credible vast compilation of data, the average years of schooling of adults is 5.1, whereas for the U.S. it's 12 years. On average, Indians study for 5 years or till 10 or 11 years old, while Americans study for 12 years or till 18 years old. This proves that the income inequality is so low and poverty levels are so high, as education levels are extremely low as compared to the U.S.

The question still remains as to why the United States has higher income inequality than India, when India has lower education rates, more poverty, fewer jobs and more people in comparison. The answer to that question has multiple reasons. One big reason is because in the US, the rich can get significantly richer whereas in India, the rich just get slightly richer. And on the other hand, in both the U.S. and India, the poor either get slightly poorer or remain as poor. In other words, it's the rich that cause the difference in wealth distribution in the country. As shown in Figure 3, for India, the percentage of millionaires in the world total is 1%, whereas the US's is 39%, making it the highest in the world. And as seen in multiple recessions, where the rich get richer, if the percentage of rich increases, the balance between poor and rich becomes unbalanced, increasing inequality altogether. A perfect example where the rich got richer can be found during the COVID lockdown. As shown in the graph (figure 2), during COVID, the billionaires made positive increased earnings (gained - above the zero axis), while the labor workers, people part of the middle to low class made negative (lost-below the zero axis) earnings. This makes logical sense as many of the billionaires' products were technological related and there was nothing to do but screens during the lockdown times, so their products were used the most. This same pattern was also found in India during the lockdown, as shown in the Lorenz curves in figure A9. Both the urban and rural parts of India had an increase in inequality, as the curve shifts farther away from the equal slope line after January 2020 to April 2020 [covid time period]. This explicitly shows how the rich get richer in any country in desperate situations. However, unlike the U.S, India's millionaires don't get filthy rich to the point they cause a huge gap between upper and lower classes. As displayed in Table 2, according to the Wealth Inequality Database of 2012, the top 1% share 30.7% of India's wealth while the bottom 50% share 6.4%. On the other hand, the top 1% share 35.7% of the USA's wealth while the bottom 50% only share 0.9%.. Although this data is from 2012, not very recent, it's still interesting to observe. The bottom 50% of the US share so little, as close to only 1% of the country's wealth, whereas at least the bottom of India's shares 6.4%, somewhat better. And not only that, but the difference between the top and bottom between both countries are so different. It really shows how unequal the US is. The millionaires gain so much during recessions and in general, creating a bigger gap between the people. Overall, India has a smaller inequality gap as compared to the US, as unlike the US, the rich cannot get so rich as to create a big bridge between the poor and them. Despite having more poverty and fewer opportunities, India was able to keep a comparatively lower gini coefficient (inequality rate), as it was a country that did not allow its rich to get so rich to take over.",Economics,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,0,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,56.82,50,13.75,"India vs United States' Equality

One may say that the U.S. also has poverty, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau, ""In 2020, there were 37.2 million people in poverty""(Consensus Bureau). Even though this number is quite high, when compared to India's 86 million being in poverty, it's nothing. In addition to poverty, India has high inequality due to lesser job opportunities and higher unemployment rates. Because the population is so large, the number of people is not proportionate to the number of jobs available, which is why so many Indians move abroad to get better and more opportunities. As mentioned above, the US has many immigrants coming to fill in the empty jobs waiting for them, which is not the same for India. India has more people, less jobs, while the U.S. has less people, more jobs. And on top of that, because technology is getting more advanced, there are fewer low-skilled jobs in India, leaving only the educated and highly- skilled people to keep their jobs. Speaking of education, the biggest difference between India and the US is the education level. According to Nation Master, a credible vast compilation of data, the average years of schooling of adults is 5.1, whereas for the U.S. it's 12 years. On average, Indians study for 5 years or till 10 or 11 years old, while Americans study for 12 years or till 18 years old. This proves that the income inequality is so low and poverty levels are so high, as education levels are extremely low as compared to the U.S.

The question still remains as to why the United States has higher income inequality than India, when India has lower education rates, more poverty, fewer jobs and more people in comparison. The answer to that question has multiple reasons. One big reason is because in the US, the rich can get significantly richer whereas in India, the rich just get slightly richer. And on the other hand, in both the U.S. and India, the poor either get slightly poorer or remain as poor. In other words, it's the rich that cause the difference in wealth distribution in the country. As shown in Figure 3, for India, the percentage of millionaires in the world total is 1%, whereas the US's is 39%, making it the highest in the world. And as seen in multiple recessions, where the rich get richer, if the percentage of rich increases, the balance between poor and rich becomes unbalanced, increasing inequality altogether. A perfect example where the rich got richer can be found during the COVID lockdown. As shown in the graph (figure 2), during COVID, the billionaires made positive increased earnings (gained - above the zero axis), while the labor workers, people part of the middle to low class made negative (lost-below the zero axis) earnings. This makes logical sense as many of the billionaires' products were technological related and there was nothing to do but screens during the lockdown times, so their products were used the most. This same pattern was also found in India during the lockdown, as shown in the Lorenz curves in figure A9. Both the urban and rural parts of India had an increase in inequality, as the curve shifts farther away from the equal slope line after January 2020 to April 2020 [covid time period]. This explicitly shows how the rich get richer in any country in desperate situations. However, unlike the U.S, India's millionaires don't get filthy rich to the point they cause a huge gap between upper and lower classes. As displayed in Table 2, according to the Wealth Inequality Database of 2012, the top 1% share 30.7% of India's wealth while the bottom 50% share 6.4%. On the other hand, the top 1% share 35.7% of the USA's wealth while the bottom 50% only share 0.9%.. Although this data is from 2012, not very recent, it's still interesting to observe. The bottom 50% of the US share so little, as close to only 1% of the country's wealth, whereas at least the bottom of India's shares 6.4%, somewhat better. And not only that, but the difference between the top and bottom between both countries are so different. It really shows how unequal the US is. The millionaires gain so much during recessions and in general, creating a bigger gap between the people. Overall, India has a smaller inequality gap as compared to the US, as unlike the US, the rich cannot get so rich as to create a big bridge between the poor and them. Despite having more poverty and fewer opportunities, India was able to keep a comparatively lower gini coefficient (inequality rate), as it was a country that did not allow its rich to get so rich to take over.",

Introduction

In the realm of philosophical inquiry, the nature of mental states has long been a subject of profound contemplation. Central to this discourse are the concepts of intentionality and consciousness, which are posited as defining features that distinguish mental states from their non-mental counterparts. This essay seeks to delve into the intricate tapestry of intentionality and consciousness, unraveling their significance as the distinctive markers of the mental realm. As we embark on this exploration, we will scrutinize the nuances of intentionality and consciousness, elucidating their role in shaping our understanding of the mind.

Intentionality: The Directedness of Mental States

At the core of mental states lies the phenomenon of intentionality, a term that signifies the inherent directedness of these states toward objects or content. Coined by the philosopher Franz Brentano in the late 19th century, intentionality asserts that mental states are inherently about something-they have an inherent reference or object. This concept stands in stark contrast to non-mental states, which lack this intrinsic orientation towards external objects.

Consider, for instance, the act of perceiving a rose. In a mental state of perception, the mind is not merely a passive receptor of sensory stimuli; rather, it actively engages with the perceived object-the rose. The mental state of perceiving the rose is intentionally directed toward the specific qualities, colors, and fragrances that characterize the flower. In contrast, non-mental states, such as a rock's hardness or a cloud's shape, lack this intentional directedness. Rocks and clouds exist, but they do not possess an inherent aboutness or intentional relation to other entities.

The significance of intentionality as the mark of the mental becomes evident when we reflect on the intricate web of mental activities that populate our conscious experience. From beliefs and desires to hopes and fears, each mental state is characterized by its intentional structure, encapsulating the dynamic interplay between subject and object. As such, intentionality emerges as a fundamental criterion that demarcates the mental realm, setting it apart from the non-mental domain.

Consciousness: The Essence of Subjective Experience

Closely intertwined with intentionality is the enigmatic concept of consciousness, a multifaceted phenomenon that encapsulates the subjective aspect of mental life. While intentionality delineates the directedness of mental states, consciousness illuminates the experiential dimension of these states-the ""what it is like"" to be in a particular mental state.

At its essence, consciousness refers to the state of being aware, the subjective quality of having an inner life. It encompasses a spectrum of experiences, ranging from the vivid colors of a sunset to the intricate emotions that accompany love or sorrow. The consciousness of mental states endows them with a subjective richness that distinguishes them from non-mental states.

Consider the mental state of joy. In experiencing joy, there is not only an intentional directedness toward the object of joy but also a subjective awareness of the joyous state itself. This dual nature of consciousness, encompassing both intentional directedness and subjective experience, reinforces its role as a pivotal characteristic of the mental realm.

Non-mental states, devoid of consciousness, lack the subjective richness that defines mental experiences. A mountain, for example, may exist in the external world, but it does not possess an inner life or subjective awareness. The absence of consciousness in non-mental states further accentuates the demarcation between the two realms-the mental and the non-mental.

The Interplay of Intentionality and Consciousness

As we navigate the intricate terrain of mental states, it becomes apparent that intentionality and consciousness are not isolated features but are intricately interwoven, forming the fabric of our conscious experience. The intentional directedness of mental states provides the framework for our engagement with the world, while consciousness imbues these intentional states with subjective depth and experiential richness.

Consider the act of remembering a cherished childhood memory. In this mental state, intentionality directs the mind toward the specific content of the memory-the laughter, the colors, the warmth. Simultaneously, consciousness bestows upon this intentional act a subjective quality, allowing us to re-live the joy or nostalgia associated with the remembered event. The confluence of intentionality and consciousness in such instances exemplifies the inseparability of these two characteristics within the realm of the mental.

Moreover, the interplay of intentionality and consciousness underscores the dynamic nature of mental life. Mental states are not static entities but fluid processes that unfold over time. The intentional directedness continually orients the mind toward new objects, while consciousness ensures that each moment of mental life is imbued with a subjective quality. This dynamic interplay contributes to the ever-evolving nature of our conscious experience.

Challenges and Considerations

While the assertion that all mental states possess intentionality and consciousness serves as a foundational premise in the philosophy of mind, it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges that arise in exploring these concepts. The nature of intentionality, for instance, has sparked debates regarding its precise definition and scope. Some argue for a narrower understanding, emphasizing a strict aboutness to objects, while others advocate for a broader interpretation that includes representational aspects of mental states.

Consciousness, too, remains an enigma with various theories vying for explanatory dominance. From the dualism of Descartes to the materialism of contemporary neuroscience, diverse perspectives seek to unravel the mysteries of consciousness. The hard problem of consciousness, as posited by David Chalmers, underscores the persistent challenge of explaining how and why subjective experience arises from neural processes.

Conclusion

In conclusion, intentionality and consciousness stand as the defining characteristics, the Mark of the mental, that distinguish mental states from their non-mental counterparts. Intentionality, with its intrinsic directedness toward objects, and consciousness, with its subjective richness, weave the intricate tapestry of our mental lives. As we traverse the landscape of mental states, we find that the interplay of intentionality and consciousness shapes the dynamic and evolving nature of our conscious experience.

While challenges and debates persist in the philosophical exploration of these concepts, the foundational premise that intentionality and consciousness are inherent to the mental realm remains a beacon guiding our understanding of the mind. In unraveling the complexities of intentionality and consciousness, we gain profound insights into the nature of human cognition and the intricate dance between subject and object within the theater of our minds.","The essay was generated using ChatGPT.

Introduction

Reciprocity, a term often associated with mutual exchange and fairness, is a fundamental concept that shapes the dynamics of human interactions. In the context of the workplace, reciprocity is often touted as a guiding principle, suggesting a give-and-take relationship between employers and employees. However, beneath the surface, the reality of reciprocity in the U.S. workplace paints a starkly different picture. While capitalists may project an image of mutual benefit, the actions and decisions of many employers reveal a discordant truth, challenging the notion of reciprocity and exposing the harsh reality faced by American workers.

The Illusion of Reciprocity

In the capitalist narrative, reciprocity is presented as a cornerstone of the employer-employee relationship. The idea is that both parties contribute to the success of the enterprise, with employees receiving fair compensation and benefits in return for their dedication and hard work. However, the reality often diverges from this idealistic portrayal. One glaring example is the ever-widening wage gap, where the compensation of top executives skyrockets while the average worker struggles to make ends meet. This vast disparity contradicts the principle of reciprocity, as the benefits of labor are disproportionately distributed.

Furthermore, the rise of precarious employment arrangements, such as gig work and temporary positions, has become a prevalent feature of the modern U.S. job market. While employers may argue that these arrangements provide flexibility, the harsh reality is that they often leave workers without job security, benefits, and a stable income. Reciprocity is undermined when employees are left vulnerable to the uncertainties of the gig economy, with little assurance of fair compensation or protection.

Exploitative Practices in the Pursuit of Profit

The pursuit of profit often takes precedence over the well-being of workers in the U.S. business landscape. Cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, downsizing, and outsourcing, are frequently implemented to maximize profits. While such strategies may benefit the bottom line, they come at the expense of the very workforce that contributes to the success of the enterprise. The harsh reality is that employees bear the brunt of these decisions, facing job insecurity, reduced benefits, and increased workloads.

Moreover, the exploitation of labor through inadequate wages and poor working conditions persists in various industries. Workers, particularly in sectors with limited union representation, find themselves subjected to substandard pay, lack of benefits, and unsafe working environments. The absence of genuine reciprocity becomes evident when the profits generated by the labor of employees do not translate into improved living standards or job satisfaction.

Erosion of Worker Rights

Reciprocity in the workplace is also undermined by the erosion of worker rights. Over the years, there has been a concerted effort to weaken labor unions and diminish the collective bargaining power of workers. Anti-union campaigns, restrictive labor laws, and the classification of workers as independent contractors instead of employees have all contributed to a landscape where employees have less agency in negotiating fair terms of employment. The power dynamics shift in favor of employers, making it challenging for workers to secure equitable treatment.

Furthermore, the suppression of employee voices and the discouragement of dissent contribute to an environment where genuine reciprocity is stifled. Whistleblowers who expose unethical practices or labor violations often face retaliation, creating a culture of fear that hinders open communication and transparency. The harsh reality is that the balance of power in the employer-employee relationship is skewed, with employees bearing the brunt of decisions that prioritize profit over their well-being.

The Impact on Employee Well-being

The harsh reality of reciprocity, or the lack thereof, in the U.S. workplace has profound implications for the well-being of employees. The stress and anxiety resulting from job insecurity, inadequate compensation, and poor working conditions can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. The elusive promise of reciprocity becomes a bitter pill to swallow for workers who find themselves grappling with the harsh realities of an unequal system.

Furthermore, the erosion of work-life balance and the blurring of boundaries between professional and personal life contribute to burnout among employees. The expectation of constant connectivity, long working hours, and the pressure to meet unrealistic targets create an environment where the toll on mental health is significant. Reciprocity, which should ideally ensure a fair exchange between time and compensation, is disrupted when the demands placed on employees exceed reasonable limits.

The Role of Corporate Culture

Corporate culture plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of reciprocity within an organization. While some companies prioritize employee well-being, genuine concern for workers is often overshadowed by profit-driven motives. Instances of toxic workplace cultures, where harassment, discrimination, and exploitation are rampant, further undermine the notion of reciprocity. Employees in such environments face an uphill battle to be treated with dignity and respect, challenging the idea that their contributions are valued and reciprocated.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the harsh reality about reciprocity in the U.S. workplace reveals a stark contrast between the rhetoric of mutual benefit and the actual treatment of employees. While capitalists may extol the virtues of a reciprocal relationship between employers and workers, the actions and decisions in the business world often paint a different picture. The widening wage gap, exploitative practices, erosion of worker rights, and the impact on employee well-being collectively challenge the notion that reciprocity exists in the U.S. workplace. It is imperative to confront this harsh reality, advocate for meaningful change, and strive towards a work environment where genuine reciprocity is not merely an illusion but a tangible and equitable reality for all.","The essay was generated using ChatGPT.

‚Ä¢ Intentionality and consciousness are characteristics of the Mark of the mental.",English,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,46,Likely Human,26.51,0.02,0,"In this paper, I will argue that ""Arguments against Intentionality/Consciousness as the Mark of the Mental""by Tim Bayne is unsound. The paper proceeds as follows. First, I will present a schematic presentation of the argument. Additionally, I will critically evaluate the argument by providing at least two criticisms for each argument, where I will be discussing potential limitations and flaws in them. Subsequently, I will present a counterexample to one of the premises, and lastly, I will have a conclusion to my explanation in the above sections. The concept of ""Intentionality/Consciousness as the Mark of the Mental"" challenges two commonly held beliefs regarding the essence of the mind. Firstly, Intentionality claims that mental states possess a directedness towards objects or an inherent aboutness. Bayne critically assesses this concept and contends that it falls short in accounting for certain mental states devoid of intentional content, such as non-conceptual sensations. The second belief, coined as ""consciousness as the Mark of the Mental,"" postulates that all mental states are conscious states. Bayne asserts that intentionality and consciousness are pivotal elements that differentiate mental states from exclusively physical occurrences. We can write his argument as follows:
‚Ä¢ All mental states possess intentionality and consciousness.
‚Ä¢ On the other hand, non-mental states lack these characteristics.
‚Ä¢ Intentionality and consciousness are characteristics of the Mark of the mental.

Let's begin with the first premise, which suffers from a conceptual mismatch. It states that all mental states possess intentionality and consciousness which gives the impression that intentionality and consciousness are inseparable. Bayne lacks the fact that there could be situations where consciousness can exist without intentionality or vice versa. The conventional perspective on intentionality asserts that mental states are either directed towards objects or possess representational content. However, we can't leave the fact that there are other mental states, such as subconscious processes and automatic reactions, that may lack intentional characteristics while still falling under the category of being considered mental.

Kriegel in his article ""Brentano's Mature Theory of Intentionality""completely resonates with my argument that intentionality and consciousness are not fully dependent on each other. He talks about the traditional belief that intentionality and consciousness are always inseparable in mental states. Kriegel challenges this conventional belief by suggesting an alternative interpretation. He puts forward Brentano's ""Immanentist""explanation of intentionality (Kriegel pg:2). Kriegel here is trying to make a point that'intentionality is a connection between a person's deliberate actions and the thoughts or ideas that exist solely within their mind' (Kriegel pg:2). This understanding suggests that not all mental states possess intentionality and consciousness at the same time. For example, I could be consciously driving a car on the street, both hands on the wheel following all rules and regulations but I can unintentionally run someone or something over. I am not intentionally operating my vehicle to get into an accident; however, I am conscious of the fact that I am driving and in control and operation of the vehicle. Thus, I can be conscious of an action whilst having an unintentional outcome or result occur during it. Both mine and Kriegel's perspective regarding consciousness and intentionality not being inseparable in all cases implies the existence of some mental states which lack any sense of
intentionality altogether.

Another criticism I have is the fact that premise 1 fully focuses on defining intentionality and consciousness such that it includes all mental states and pays little to no attention to the physical and non-mental states. To further elaborate my point here, I would like to share an example; let's suppose you are taking a hot shower and the water instantly starts coming out freezing cold. The person in the shower will react quickly and try to either turn the shower off or move it back to the warm water. Now this is a very simple example but if we think about this the reaction would be a spontaneous one. I do believe that there was a thought involved in this reaction, but it didn't really have a purpose. Bayne's argument might not be fully wrong, but it would have made more sense if he had paid some attention to how mental states could sometimes arise or be influenced by physical or non-mental states. A lot of time we have thoughts just laying in the back of our heads and they get triggered when we physically interact with them. Situations like these lead to having an impact on our behavior without conscious or explicit intention.

Next, let's discuss the second premise. Which states that nonmental states lack intentionality and consciousness. Premise two faces criticism because of its inadequate definition of non- mental states. Bayne assumes that non-mental states lack intentionality and consciousness. But he did not clarify what exactly are the non-mental states. Maybe there are just some non-mental states that lack intentionality and consciousness. Below, I have discussed some potential flaws on why I think Baynes declaring all non-mental states being unconscious and unintentionally wrong. ""The Cognitive Unconscious""by Kihlstrom, talks about the mental processes especially outside of cognitive consciousness. In his research some of the cognitive consciousness includes implicit memory, subliminal stimuli, and automaticity. Kihlstrom explored the above consciousness with a focus on mental processes outside of conscious awareness. Kihlstrom in his research investigates different mechanisms and methods that cognitive unconscious operates, with a focus on the crucial role implicit memory plays. Kihlstrom states: ""Unlike automatized procedural knowledge, these percepts and memories [implicit memory] would be available to awareness under ordinary circumstances.""(Vol. 237, pg 7) By the quote we can tell that Kihlstrom's is examining the mechanisms by which cognitive unconscious functions and demonstrates how implicit memory plays an important part in how it functions. The retention and use of knowledge without conscious awareness is referred to as implicit memory. Let's talk about the situations when we quickly recognize a familiar face or situation, without actively remembering them. Kihlstrom in his article also discusses the influence of subliminal cues on behavior. Signals or messages delivered below the threshold of conscious perception are referred to as subliminal stimuli and how these key points can affect people's thoughts and behaviors. People's opinions and actions toward a certain subject or product can be positively influenced by subliminal messages. Kihlstrom emphasizes the significance of comprehending the cognitive unconscious in influencing human behavior, and general cognitive functioning by concentrating on these mental processes. Through the above explanation, we can say that the belief that all mental processes are consciously tractable is consistently being challenged as the human mind is a complex subject.

The preconscious thoughts, which are believed to be a component of the non-mental states according to premise 2, are another issue I would want to challenge in this argument. Preconscious thoughts are mental states that occur outside of our conscious knowledge. I will be discussing Mcleod's article ""Freud and the Unconscious Mind"" to support my criticism. In it, he examines Sigmund Freud's Iceberg theory, which describes and distinguishes between the conscious and unconscious minds. Although our ideas' perceptions are controlled by the conscious mind, according to Freud, our preconscious and unconscious states are significantly more complicated since they deal with suppressed memories, emotions, and feelings. Mcleod quotes Freud's idea by saying,'The preconscious is always there in the backend of our head where all our thoughts remain, in until they ""succeed in attracting the eye of the conscious""(Freud, 1924, p. 306)'. Freud here saying that preconscious thought could potentially lead to being conscious and having intentionality. Let's say someone was walking down the street when he spotted somebody familiar, but he wasn't sure if he knew the person at the time. Currently, this is a pre-conscious stage that is awaiting consent from the subject's eye of consciousness to be in that state. Similarly, observing a couple sitting together in a park is a pre-conscious state since there are feelings present positive or negative, which may be deliberate and result in consciousness. This leads us to the conclusion that not all non-mental states may be regarded as unconscious and unintentional since, as shown in the examples above, they may eventually give rise to mental qualities.

I will be showing a counterexample for premise 1, which states that all mental states possess intentionality and consciousness. I will be proving that there exist unconscious activities that could potentially lead to a mental state. So, what are unconscious activities? We can consider sleeping as an unconscious activity because we are not really doing anything but relaxing. But what about sleeping, particularly in the context of dreams? We can all agree that our brain is functioning when we are dreaming while sleeping, so we could say that dreams are regarded to be a manifestation of numerous mental processes. Although dreams might lack a distinct aim or direction, in the article, ""Sleep and Incubation""by Kristin Sanders, she states ""During sleep, external input is considerably reduced, and information processing is generally considered unconscious; yet meaningful cognitive processing occurs during sleep‚Äù(Sanders). The quote summarizes my point in more detail by showing us how dreams can characterize intentional mental states. Which basically ensures that intentional mental states are not necessarily conscious mental activities. Now a person could see multiple dreams and they could be completely unrelatable to each other, which brings us back to Sander's quote that memories, emotions, and subliminal thoughts can have an impact on the context of the dream, and they don't necessarily need to have an explicit conscious aim. The above discussion about dreams shows that mental processes could happen without any conscious awareness or implicit intention and that not all mental states may exhibit intentionality and consciousness altogether. This makes us question if Bayne's premise 1 is even valid.

In conclusion, I have argued that Bayne's argument fails to establish that intentionality or consciousness can be seen as the characteristics of the mental state. This clearly does not mean that Bayne's argument is incorrect, it just signifies the fact that Bayne could have possibly considered more options. Non-mental states can lead to mental and have intentionality and consciousness. Regarding mental and non-mental states, it is still a huge debate however through my self-reflection, and the sources and literature used to support them, I can argue confidently that Bayne's ideologies are not entirely correct and that there is more to this topic.",
4588,1- Entirely written by me,"The harsh reality about reciprocity in the U.S.

Reciprocity might exist in the U.S. in ""employer's""perspective, but the sources have something else to say.",English,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,3,Likely Human,40.32,0.03,14.19,"The harsh reality about reciprocity in the U.S.

Reciprocity might exist in the U.S. in ""employer's""perspective, but the sources have something else to say.

Although U.S. is one of the most developed and economically strong country, but it is still struggling to maintain reciprocity between its employees and the employers. U.S. has a mixed economy, but the people who really rule most of the country's economy are the capitalists. In Jeffrey Pfeffer's, bibliography Human Resource from an Organization Behavior Perspective, he talks about the everyday interactions and the norms of reciprocity between the employees and the employers. Pfeffer in his bibliography mentions reciprocity as one of the most important fundamental that controls human behavior. He mentions that the concept of reciprocity is not new to the society, but it has been studied and governed in every human culture and workforce. Pfeffer also states the lack of reciprocity in the workplace and how it is detrimental to the outcome of the companies' overall performance. Daniel Pink in his book Drive: Purpose corelates to what Pfeffer talked about in his bibliography. Pink in his book talks about how employers would use employees for their personal benefit and when things don't seem to be going the right way they would, compromise on reciprocity, leaving the employees in a disbelief and insecure about their job security. In the bibliography Race, Gender, and Workplace power by James R Elliot and Ryan A, Smith, the authors have talked about how the management at workplace is violating the terms of reciprocity. They further made strict analysis on how workers usually attain power through homosocial reproduction, and how the minorities miss the opportunity to engage, in such situations. All the concepts talked in these sources reflect on the recent article Big Tech Is Laying Off Tons of Workers. That's a Bad Sign for Your Company, by Nik Popli. Where Popli has discussed on why one of the biggest Tech companies decided to lay off its workers, how has this affected people lives and how it violates the basic rules of reciprocity. Although capitalists might make it seem like reciprocity exists in the U.S. but their actions and decisions towards its employees really make it hard to believe.

The value that both employees and employers should have for one another is one of the key aspects of reciprocity. But do employers even consider their workers to be valuable? While the U.S. economy is consistently growing and generating job opportunities but do these jobs even treat their employees fairly? In advanced industrialized economies such as The United States, where employee skill and innovation are comparatively more important, much of a company's value resides in intangible assets. 1 Pfeffer here is stating some facts about the employers, the idea that has been continued for decades. He's saying how employers don't count their employees as an asset, and when something is of no value it is easily replaceable. Employers instead, value intangible assets such as bonds, equity, and patent portfolios, things that hold value and will bring them profit. Employers here are violating the rules of reciprocity by making employees work hard and offering them no job securities or appreciating their efforts to let them know that their presence is valued. Humans, by their nature, seek purpose a cause greater and more enduring than themselves but traditional businesses have long considered purpose ornamental a perfectly nice accessory, so long as it didn't get in the way of the important things. 2 Pink here is telling how humans tend to seek purpose at their workplace, but businesses think of this nature as an accessory, an instrumental value and not a symbolic or communicative value. In employer's perspective reciprocity exists as they pay employees for their work. But employees are not just working to get paid but to grow with the company and be a part of it. Reciprocity does exist in employers' perspective, as they might be appreciating employees' work, giving them benefits, and paying them a competitive salary but this is not what employees desire. The rules of reciprocity don't work when one person doesn't value others' existence and interests. Hence this clearly proves that reciprocity doesn't exist in the U.S. economy, at least for the majority of the workers.

Employers not giving value to their employees and treating them unfairly is an issue but the other major issue that violates reciprocity is not giving equal opportunities to women and other minorities. Another broad mechanism presumed to generate increasing inequalities in workplace power involves a more indirect process, namely the exclusion of women and minorities, relative to white men, from networks that regulate access to information, opportunities, and resources needed to advance in the workplace.3 Both Elliot and Smith here are stating the harsh reality of these capitalist organizations. Employees' lives can be negatively affected when companies do not follow reciprocity principles. Giving opportunities to only white individuals and not the women and other minorities is just not fair with them. Women and minorities often rely more on education and experience, relative to white men, to ""break into""higher levels of power, often having to ""out-credential""white-male counterparts to compensate for their relative lack of network assistance.4 Through this quote we could clearly see that women and other minorities must work 2x more than other white individuals to be considered for opportunities to grow, especially without network assistance. Reciprocity is the idea that people should respond to each other's actions in a similar way that they were treated. In the workplace, this means that employees should be treated fairly and with respect, and in return, they should be given equal opportunities and support for their hard work and dedication. Companies these days do not follow reciprocity principles, and because of that minorities feel undervalued and unappreciated. Women and other minorities don't really receive fair compensation for their work or opportunities for career development. This can lead to low morale and job dissatisfaction, which can affect their mental and physical health. Overall, when companies do not follow reciprocity principles, the lives of their employees are negatively affected, and this can have negative consequences for the company as well.

The principles of reciprocity can only be tested when an economy is facing hard times. A lot of companies in their job profile mention their miraculous and attractive benefits and policies to attract more talent to apply, but is that even true? According to Popli and the current raise in the inflation rates, it is not hidden that the U.S. will soon fall into recession and the strong reciprocity principles of the big tech companies will be tested. Even before the U.S. officialls declares recession, The Meta CEO explained to employees that he will be making the largest- scale layoffs in company history in an effort to cut costs after last month's disappointing quarterly earnings report. 5 Although this might be the right decision for Meta, but who is responsible here? When these big companies' layoff its employees its usually the people at lower level who have to suffer, which according to Elliot and Smith are mostly women's and other minorities. So how is that fair to these people? This is a clear example of why reciprocity couldn't work in the U.S. economy. Capitalists value reciprocity but to a certain extent. Running the business is a much higher priority for them, and when it comes to cutting costs, laying off is the first decision they make. Wayne Chang the founder CEO of Digits states: I've been through lots of these cycles, and in my eyes, what's probably going to happen is hiring will pick up again once the economy stabilizes employers don't really value their employees' efforts. The time when workers needed their employers' the most, they aren't there, so why would they ever trust them again? Because of this treatment of Meta, and other capitalist organizations like Digits, their employees will never put in any effort or believe in their work again. Such actions form companies make employees not believe in reciprocity, they will always assume that they will be fired at some point and that their previous efforts will be disregarded. This imitative behavior of capitalists might be normal for them but for employees it is something that will change their perspective about reciprocity forever. This is one of the reasons why reciprocity could never exist in the U.S. economy.

In conclusion, reciprocity cannot thrive in the United States due to the unequal treatment of employees by capitalist organizations. In capitalism, businesses often prioritize their own profits over the well-being of their workers, which makes it challenging for the principle of reciprocity to take hold. Violating the principles of reciprocity creates an environment where people are not inclined to help each other or return favors. Furthermore, the unequal distribution of power based on color and gender and ethnicity leads to a power imbalance that hinders the potential for reciprocity to exist.",
3333,4- AI-generated,"Who is a better basketball player, LeBron James, or Michael Jordan?",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,96,Likely AI,83,0.02,99.82,"Title: LeBron James: A Compelling Case for Basketball Greatness Over Michael Jordan

Introduction:

The debate over who stands as the greatest basketball player of all time has long been dominated by the names Michael Jordan and LeBron James. While Michael Jordan's legacy is etched in the annals of basketball history, the argument that LeBron James surpasses him in various aspects of the game is compelling. This essay aims to articulate why LeBron James can be considered better than Michael Jordan by examining his versatility, longevity, leadership, and impact on and off the court.

Body:

*

Versatility:

One of the key elements that distinguish LeBron James from Michael Jordan is his unparalleled versatility. James has consistently demonstrated the ability to impact every facet of the game-scoring, rebounding, playmaking, and defense. His capability to seamlessly transition between positions and contribute in various roles makes him a more versatile player than Jordan. LeBron's well-rounded skill set enables him to adapt to different game scenarios, making him a more dynamic force on the court.

*

Longevity:

LeBron James has showcased an unprecedented level of longevity in his career. While Michael Jordan's prime was undoubtedly extraordinary, LeBron has maintained an elite level of performance well into his 30s. His commitment to physical fitness, injury prevention, and evolving his game has allowed him to sustain a high level of play for an extended period. This longevity not only speaks to his athletic prowess but also contributes to a more extended period of influence on the game compared to Jordan.

*

Leadership:

LeBron James has proven to be not only a prolific scorer but also a remarkable leader both on and off the court. His ability to elevate the play of his teammates, create a positive team culture, and contribute as a vocal leader distinguishes him in the comparison with Michael Jordan. While Jordan's leadership style was characterized by intensity and competitiveness, LeBron's leadership is marked by a combination of inspiration and empowerment, fostering a sense of camaraderie that extends beyond the game itself.

*

Off-Court Impact:

LeBron James's impact transcends the basketball court. Through initiatives like the LeBron James Family Foundation, he has committed himself to philanthropy, education, and social justice causes. Jordan, while undeniably influential in popularizing basketball globally, did not have the same level of visible and sustained impact off the court during his playing career. LeBron's commitment to social issues and community development adds a layer to his legacy that extends beyond the realm of basketball.

Conclusion:

In the ongoing debate between LeBron James and Michael Jordan, the case for LeBron's superiority is grounded in his exceptional versatility, longevity, leadership, and off-court impact. While both players have left an indelible mark on the sport, LeBron's ability to adapt, maintain an elite level of play over an extended period, lead with a unique style, and contribute meaningfully to societal issues make a compelling argument for his claim to the title of the greatest basketball player of all time. As the NBA continues to evolve, LeBron James stands as a testament to the ever-expanding definition of greatness in the world of basketball.","Chat GPT

1199,4- AI-generated,In what ways is hegemony perpetuated through the ideas of neoliberalism and capturing and how does it influence the economic landscape of America?,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,91,Likely AI,78,0.02,99.8,"Introduction:

Hegemony, a concept rooted in the works of Antonio Gramsci, refers to the dominance of a particular group or ideology over others through the dissemination and normalization of its values, norms, and beliefs. In the contemporary context, neoliberalism has emerged as a potent force in perpetuating hegemony, shaping the economic landscape of America through mechanisms like regulatory capture. This essay delves into the ways in which neoliberalism and capturing sustain hegemony and wield considerable influence over the economic dynamics of the United States.

Body:

*

Ideological Foundations of Neoliberalism:

Neoliberalism, as an economic and political philosophy, asserts that free markets, minimal government intervention, and individual self-interest are the pillars of economic prosperity. This ideology has been instrumental in consolidating the power of a select few by legitimizing the accumulation of wealth and the concentration of resources in the hands of a privileged minority. The ideas of neoliberalism become a powerful tool for perpetuating hegemony as they shape public discourse and policy decisions in favor of the economic elite.

*

Regulatory Capture as a Mechanism of Hegemony:

Regulatory capture occurs when regulatory agencies, instead of serving the public interest, become subservient to the industries they are supposed to regulate. This phenomenon is deeply intertwined with neoliberal principles, as the reduction of regulatory barriers is a core tenet of this ideology. By capturing regulatory bodies, powerful corporations can influence policies in their favor, creating a system where the rules of the game are set to benefit the elite. This not only perpetuates existing power structures but also erects formidable barriers for new entrants, solidifying the hegemonic grip of established players.

*

Financialization and Income Inequality:

Neoliberalism has contributed significantly to the financialization of the economy, where the financial sector's influence extends far beyond its traditional role. This has led to the prioritization of shareholder value over broader societal concerns, exacerbating income inequality. As wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, the economic elite gains disproportionate influence over political processes, further entrenching their hegemonic position.

*

Market Fundamentalism and Deregulation:

Neoliberalism advocates for the belief in the inherent efficiency of free markets. However, this often translates into a push for deregulation, enabling powerful corporations to operate with minimal oversight. The dismantling of regulatory frameworks allows these entities to engage in practices that prioritize profit over ethical considerations, perpetuating a cycle of economic dominance that consolidates their hegemonic position.

*

Globalization and Economic Imperialism:

Neoliberalism's embrace of globalization has facilitated economic imperialism, where powerful nations and corporations exploit the resources and labor of less powerful nations. This not only perpetuates global inequalities but also reinforces the hegemony of economically dominant nations, further concentrating power in the hands of a select few.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the perpetuation of hegemony through neoliberalism and capturing mechanisms has profound implications for the economic landscape of America. The ideological foundations of neoliberalism, coupled with regulatory capture, financialization, deregulation, and globalization, create a web of influence that consolidates power among the economic elite. Recognizing and addressing these mechanisms is crucial for fostering a more equitable economic system that prioritizes the interests of the many over the few, challenging the entrenched hegemony that currently defines America's economic landscape.","Chat GPT

810,1- Entirely written by me,Evaluate the effectiveness of foot in the door technique,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,C,Likely Written by Human,7,Likely Human,45,0.02,24.72,"Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Foot-In-The-Door Technique

People often employ a variety of techniques to increase the chances of getting their requests fulfilled (Dolinski, 2012). One of these techniques is called the foot-in-the-door technique (FITD). FITD involves the use of a smaller request to get approval for a larger, more complex request. The idea is that if the opposing party agrees to a simpler request first, then momentum is built and a complicated request is more likely to have success.

Research Study

Rationale

In 2012, Dolinski conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the FITD technique. The rationale behind the study was to see if the unusuality of the initial request made a difference in the likelihood of the second request being fulfilled. This study sought to extend on a previous study conducted by Santos, Leve, and Pratkanis (1994) in which panhandlers asked for an unusual amount of change (17 cents) compared to a typical quarter. As a result, two types of initial requests were formulated: an easy and typical request, and an easy but unusual request. The data for these different types of requests would be compared to see if one type of request had an advantage over the other.

Methods

Dolinski (2012) examined three possible request conditions outlined in the study- no request, unusual request, and typical request. The participants were divided equally by gender- 25 men and 25 women. These men and women, also called confederates, conducted the study on the ground. The typical request condition consisted of the confederate requesting a random shopper to fill out a short survey with two questions. The unusual request condition involved a young confederate requesting a shopper to tie his shoe for him, claiming that he suffered from chronic back pain. The second, complex request involved a female confederate requesting a shopper to watch her shopping cart for her while she looked for her husband. The control condition was the female confederate requesting the stranger to watch the shopping cart without any prior requests being made.

Results

According to Dolinski (2012), the study showed that gender did not have a significant factor in whether the initial or final requests were fulfilled. Approximately the same number of people complied with the survey request and the shoelace request. For the shopping cart request, people that tied the shoelace were much more likely to agree compared to the people that filled out the survey. Only 50% of survey participants agreed to watch the shopping cart, compared with almost 75% of people who tied the shoelace. The difference between the unusual and typical requests ended up being statistically significant. This shows that the effectiveness of the foot in the door technique can be enhanced significantly by increasing the strangeness of the initial requests, and not necessarily the difficulty.

Discussion

Dolinski (2012) concludes that the ""uncommonness of the first, initial request may enhance the effectiveness of the foot-in-the-door technique.""The more unusual the request, the more likely it would be that the person would stop and think about the situation, and prepare themselves mentally to help others in the future. This helped specify what kind of initial request would increase the likelihood of success for the second request, which past researchers struggled with. Future researchers would be able to take advantage of this data and conduct more efficient studies. However, these findings do not guarantee that the FITD technique will be successful 100% of the time

FITD in Media

Media Example

The media example chosen comes from the television show, The Big Bang Theory. The situational aspect is that Sheldon, the main character, is not feeling well, and asks his friend, Penny, to help him. Sheldon asks her to rub Vicks all over her chest. Penny begrudgingly agrees, but then Sheldon uses the FITD technique to get Penny to sing him a song of his choosing. Had Sheldon not asked Penny to rub Vicks on his chest, she may not have agreed to sing for him, highlighting an example of the FITD technique. The relational and cultural aspect of this encounter is Penny and Sheldon's status as friends. Had they been strangers, then this scenario probably would have never happened. However, the culture of the time suggests that it is normal for friends to take care of each other. The environment featured Sheldon's apartment, where he and Penny were granted privacy. Had the setting been anywhere in public, it would have made the FITD technique ineffective for this particular case. Psychologically, if Penny and Sheldon weren't such good friends, then this would have made for an awkward encounter. At the time, it was simply not normal for total strangers to rub each other's chests while singing.

Personal Example

Going to the Gym

I like to work out to keep myself in shape. However, physically getting myself to the gym usually proves to be the main hurdle- not the workout itself. The main issue is transportation. I drive my parents' car, which means I need to ask them for permission. Otherwise, I am unable to transport myself to the gym and miss the workout. To get my foot in the door, I first wait until the situation is safe. I make sure that my parents are in a good mood and then I ask them if I can go to the gym. Since they want me to be healthy, they say yes. I then ask them if I can take the car to the gym so that they are not bothered. Because they already agreed that I can go to the gym, they usually say yes. I am usually successful because I am aware of the relational dynamic between parent and son. I understand that my parents wield the power, so I ask them respectfully. Since I ask them so politely, they cannot find a reason to say no to my simple request. At the end of the day, we both win- I get my workout in, and they feel happy that their son is respectful.

Conclusion

The foot-in-the-door technique has been around for more than fifty years (Dolinski, 2012), but its effectiveness has gradually improved over time as more research has been conducted. Dolinski's (2012) study found that making bizarre, but easy requests may be more effective than a request that doesn't involve much brainpower. I have witnessed this phenomenon in both television and in my personal experience. Based on the many studies performed on this phenomenon, it may be safe to say that the FITD theory is scientifically proven to be statistically significant, and can be leveraged in one's everyday life.",
7925,1- Entirely written by me,Media's role in politics,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,8,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,57,0.02,33,"The news media is a major source for how US citizens get their information on a daily basis, specifically cable news. Citizens rely on the news for information about world events, the economy, politics, and many other important topics. However, not all news sources are created equally. Some news sources may employ a partisan bias leaning towards either the left or the right side of the political spectrum. If people develop their political stance and ideology based on the information they receive, then the channel which delivers that information carries great influence. An example of this phenomenon is CNN vs Fox News. CNN is more left-leaning, whereas Fox is more right-leaning. An individual will probably share the same ideology as the network they choose.

The phenomenon of an echo chamber refers to a person only consuming content that confirms their biases without any opportunity for rebuttal. If a person only consumes right-wing media on Fox, chances are that they will agree with all conservative talking points without a second thought. This is because Fox reaffirms their bias without allowing any outside disagreement. All shows on Fox lean to the right with very few exceptions. On the other side of the spectrum, we can see the same thing with CNN. All shows on CNN lean to the left, with very few exceptions. There are no right wing figures who can attempt to rebuke the left-wing talking points. If someone were to only consume CNN content, chances are that their political ideology would lean to the left due to the lack of opposing viewpoints. This phenomenon is similar to what Douglas Rushkoff described in Atmospherics, where the store was designed to trap the shopper and make them forget what they originally came in for. These cable news shows are designed to trap the viewer into one point of view and reject all others.

Whether someone leans to the left or right politically is besides the point. The main point is that these confirmation biases heavily affect the state of the citizenry as we know it. People become divided based on their ideology, and note their differences, rather than their similarities. A right-winger may think that all liberals are bad because Fox News told them so. A liberal may think all right-wingers are extremists because CNN told them so. In reality, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, and these cable news networks are doing a poor job of trying to discover it. This lack of clarity causes people to be divided and sever relationships solely based on politics. This was not always the case. There was once a time when people could disagree politically and still get along, but now it seems to be a battle of good versus evil. This shift can be attributed to the role that the media has played in influencing people's viewpoints. People's concept of self can be distorted in such a way that they no longer are within the sane boundaries of society (Susman). The fact that the same piece of news can be spun in so many different ways shows how the medium in which the news is delivered is equally as important as the news itself. The rise of ""cancel culture"", as described by Meredith Clark, causes citizens to censor and cancel one another for not believing the same things. This diversity of thought is the reason America is so strong in the first place. This is especially true on contentious topics, such as war. During times of war, citizens must present a united front, but if they are divided, then they will crumble (Militarism and the Media, Gusterson). As the great Abraham Lincoln once said, ""A house divided against itself can not stand.""

The media holds a very powerful sway on the lives of Americans. An individual's entire political ideology could be influenced simply by the news network of their choosing. The lack of opposing viewpoints presented by these channels does not help matters either. Confirmation bias and echo chambers enable people to believe that their beliefs are the absolute truth, because they have not been presented with any evidence to the contrary.",

This system has gained attention in the United States as a potential solution to various electoral challenges, including the prevalence of negative campaigning, the ""spoiler effect,"" and voter dissatisfaction with limited choices. In RCV, if no candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes for that candidate are redistributed to the next ranked candidate on each voter's ballot. This process continues until one candidate secures a majority. This essay explores the viability of RCV and how its widespread adoption might benefit the U.S. political landscape.

Among the main advantages of RCV is its potential to mitigate the spoiler effect, where votes are split between similar candidates, often resulting in the election of a candidate who might not reflect the majority's preference. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, for instance, some argue that Ralph Nader's candidacy siphoned votes from Al Gore, contributing to George W. Bush's victory. RCV could alleviate this issue, as voters can rank similar candidates without fear of inadvertently aiding their least preferred option. Furthermore, RCV could encourage more positive campaigning. Candidates might be less inclined to alienate supporters of other candidates, whom they might need as second or third choices.

Moreover, RCV could enhance voter engagement and satisfaction. Traditional plurality voting often forces voters to choose between the ""lesser of two evils,"" potentially leading to voter apathy and low turnout. With RCV, voters can support their preferred candidate without the risk of ""wasting"" their vote. This could lead to a more diverse range of candidates, as those with less initial support might still be competitive through second- and third-choice votes. Additionally, RCV could reduce the need for primary elections, as multiple candidates from the same party can run without splitting the vote, possibly saving costs and simplifying the electoral process.

The adoption of ranked choice voting in the United States presents a viable and potentially transformative approach to addressing several electoral issues. By mitigating the spoiler effect and promoting more positive campaigning, RCV could create a political environment that is both more inclusive and representative of the electorate's true preferences. Furthermore, the potential increase in voter engagement and satisfaction, coupled with the cost-saving aspect of possibly eliminating primaries, underscores RCV's benefits. While the implementation of RCV would require significant changes to the current electoral system, its potential to enhance the democratic process makes it a worthwhile consideration for the future of U.S. elections.","I used Chatgpt, and gave some specific instructions:

5677,1- Entirely written by me,"Are humans and machines biased in the same ways? Extract and reconstruct one argument that responds positively to this question- so Johnson's Argument from Counterfactual Programming or Munton's Argument for Gerrymandered Visual Priors. After extracting and reconstructing the argument, you should then evaluate it. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",Other,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,47,Likely Human,37,0,8,"Munton often refers to ""Technically Unimpeachable Prejudicial Experiences""(Munton, Pg.132) or TUPES for short. The culmination of these experiences contribute to one's prejudiced views, as she argues that they serve to justify preconceived biases that are instilled by society. One of the examples that is presented in the paper is the case of Grace, a coder, who assumes that a group of coders in a dimly-lit illuminated by computer screens are all white, when the blue-light from the screens may ""whitewash""Black coders. This leap of logic is founded upon her statistical knowledge of there being fewer than 5% of Black coders. Her speculation is not illogical as she may very well be correct in her assumption, and the statistical data does not appear to be biased. However, this assumption could lead to negative consequences. In the future, Grace might be asked to interview people for a position on her team. Because of her subconscious beliefs that were established by looking into the room, she may unintentionally favor white coders over similarly skilled Black coders, because of her ""gerrymandered prior""that ""Black people don't code.""

A worrying conclusion one might draw about these learned biases is that at first glance they are often rooted in visually accurate information, yet they can often be skewed by improper attention to detail and context. Munton defines a gerrymandered prior by stating ""A prior is gerrymandered if its accuracy is covertly dependent on the on-going manipulation of the subject's environment.""(Munton, pg.148). These priors are formed due to the repeated exposure to a particular type of stimulus, and they become ingrained in the visual system, as was the case with Grace, as she looked over each coder in the room but did not see any Black coders.The prior is specialized to recognize a stimulus, but it may not be able to adjust to new or unfamiliar situations. This could lead to a decrease in a perceptual skills when the broader context is relevant and the subject is unable to process new information accurately.

These gerrymandered visual priors are ubiquitous among people, and their ramifications are profound. A salient example of this is the underlying racism of local (and national, to a slightly lesser degree, depending on the broadcast) news broadcasting. There is often an emphasis on covering crime, as that drives views and ratings. It has been extensively proven that crimes involving Black and other non-white perpetrators are covered with drastically disparate tones and language. In turn, this difference in coverage leads to watchers becoming more reactionary in their viewpoints, believing that non-whites are inherently more aggressive and predisposed to crime. These reinforced gerrymandered priors then ingrain themselves in our social structures through a multitude of avenues. Politicians will campaign for policies to address the perceived issues, and unknowingly biased voters will support them (They can't be racist, they have one black friend!). Programmers will code algorithms that unintentionally highlight harmful rhetoric, and the cycle repeats itself ad infinitum. As Munton explains, ""structural injustice is more likely to gerrymander a prior in problematic ways than structurally just social systems.""(Munton, Pg. 154). The biases and injustices present in our social structures can shape our perception and create gerrymandered priors. Our visual system draws on prior knowledge to guide our perception, but if these priors are gerrymandered, it can lead to a distorted understanding of the world around us, highlighting how even our perception of reality itself can be influenced by gerrymandered priors.

Gerrymandering of priors is epistemically problematic because it ""gives rise to a basic tension in our capacity to gather information."" (Munton, Pg.153). Data and statistics is (or rather, should be) a huge factor incorporated into decision making in our society, and when the reporting bodies are biased by gerrymandered priors, the whole system begins to crumble. In addition to the impact on decision making, gerrymandered priors can also affect the accuracy of scientific research. Munton notes that ""gerrymandered samples systematically misrepresent the class in question"" (Pg. 153). This means that when researchers rely on biased samples or data sets, their conclusions can be flawed, and their findings may not accurately represent the reality they are trying to understand. Furthermore, the influence of social structures on perception can lead to gerrymandered priors.

The pervasiveness of bias in machine learning systems has become an increasingly concerning issue. Just like the human visual system relies on stored information about the context in which an object is presented to recognize objects, machine learning algorithms rely on vast datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions.",
6249,1- Entirely written by me,How does SF interrogate the boundaries of humanity?,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,23,Likely Human,20,0,7,"How Humanity, Humans, and People Differ in Science Fiction

Humanity and personhood are often intertwined, used interchangeably to describe human beings, the only form of'people' known to exist. Humanity is a concept that is not so easily summarized, with multiple interpretations seeming to incorporate a myriad of ways that one might define what constitutes a'person'. One might posit that personhood is the ability for a being to have conscious thought and be capable of making their own choices, and to be able to display emotions like fear, compassion, and love. Others may argue that a person ceases to be human when they engage in inhumane acts; some may declare that a serial killer, solely due to his actions, loses a portion of their humanity and becomes a monster.'Monster' also becomes a term with an ambiguous meaning, and in Science Fiction, the positions of humanity and monstrosity are not clearly defined along the lines of humans and non-humans. These sentiments are explored by Kij Johnson in her story ""The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change'' and Nnedi Okorafor in her novella ""Binti"". Do talking dogs become people? Can cephalopod-like aliens show humanity? Science Fiction considers how personhood can be extended to all sentient life by casting conventionally human qualities onto non-human characters, while simultaneously transposing conventionally monstrous qualities centering around prejudice and ignorance onto actual human beings.

Science Fiction stories often have non-human characters who seem to have incredibly human emotions and motivations, even more so than most of the biological humans, blurring the lines between humanity and humans. Well-written fiction often ignores the tropes of absolute good and evil, instead preferring to add a layer of realism to characters by giving them varied and conflicting motivations and morals. This is mirrored in Science Fiction, where sometimes the conventional good side, the side of humans, does not become a monolith for justice, but for exclusion. In Okorafor's ""Binti'', the main character reflects upon the humanity found within a disparaged alien race; ""The Meduse are not what we humans think. They are truth. They are clarity. They are decisive. There are sharp lines and edges. They understand honor and dishonor."" (Okorafor, Pg.40). Binti's experience with the Meduse conflicts directly with what she was taught about them, largely by the education system structured by the Koush, the oppressing class in the story. Humanity encompasses a wide range of human emotions and desires, with the negative aspects often being overlooked. In ""Binti"", the notions of honor, clarity and truth, all positive human characteristics, are attributed to the least human-looking people in the story, people who are often demonized by the ruling class. Instead of unique values, the Meduse exemplify many noble qualities associated with humanity. In her piece, Vint asserts that ""Humans are uniquely able to see that there is something more important than one's own life- that is, the life of the other, the ethical appeal of the'I am' which is the face of the other- and hence humans live within a condition of ethics while animals exist merely in a struggle for life outside of ethics.""(Vint, pg.10). Using this logical framework, many of the non-human races in Science Fiction are able to fit into the definition of ""humanity"". The Meduse are not animals, they have morals and values that they adhere to and do not compromise. Binti is able to discern this based upon her direct interaction with the species, and her separation from the Koush culture allows her to relate somewhat to the Meduse.

One of the main tenets of the human condition explored by Science Fiction is the obsession with exclusion and otherizing those who possess many of the same inherent'human' characteristics. The collective human societies in the pieces usually display immediate distrust and hostility towards any being regarded as alien to them. In her piece ""Animal Alterity: Science Fiction and the Question of the Animal'', Sherryl Vint suggests that ""The desire to preserve some grounds for human exceptionalism is the unspoken subtext that fuels much of the anxiety circulating around the question of sentience and how we might recognise its presence in a non-human being.""(Vint, pg.9). This ""exceptionalism""is rooted in people's desire to preserve their status. By refusing to accept a being as an equal, one can assure themselves that they are superior and belong in a higher standing. Along with this desire to maintain a higher social ranking comes a willful ignorance of the humanity of the other party, and an underlying shame that prevents one from recognizing their prejudice. In the story ""The Evolution of Trickster Stories Among the Dogs of North Park After the Change '', the narrator poses the question ""Why do we fear them when they learn speech? They are still dogs, still subordinate to us. It doesn't change who they are or their loyalty. (It is not always fear we run from. Sometimes it is shame.)""(Johnson, Pg.14). In the story, the talking dogs and animals don't directly threaten the societal structure by their actions, they indirectly threaten it with their existence. After the Change, it is more difficult for people to cope with the fact that their pets and livestock became intelligent beings with the ability to express their emotions. The humans in the story become afraid of what the animals might say of them, that they might challenge the illusion of human exceptionalism.

Science Fiction often explores humanity by juxtaposing the positive or'human' traits of non-humans with the negative or'monstrous' characteristics in human characters, with a merge of the two dichotomies defining humanity as a concept. In Okorafor's ""Binti"", the Meduse Okwu becomes outraged by the insinuation that its people might act as wantonly as humans;'""You think we are like you humans?""it asked, angrily. ""We don't kill for sport or even for gain. Only for purpose.""' (Okorafor, Pg.34). To non-humans,'humanity' as a positive concept is the antithesis of what human beings represent. They perform horribly evil deeds without any particular reason outside of their own moral failings and ignorance. However, since Science Fiction is rooted in reality and the social dynamics of people in the present, many of the relationships represented in the two stories have parallels in contemporary culture. Humans constitute both sides of the spectrum, evil and good are firmly meshed together within the fabric of humanity, and both extend indefinitely in all directions, without boundary.",

Introduction The role of infrastructure investment in economic growth and stability is a central theme in macroeconomic policy. This paper delves into the multifaceted impacts of increased infrastructure spending, examining its effects in both the short and long term, its influence on the various components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the Keynesian perspective on government spending. Additionally, it explores the specific implications of these economic dynamics within individual states.

1. Short-Term Impact on Employment and Economic Output In the short run, increased infrastructure spending is widely anticipated to stimulate both employment and economic output. This is primarily due to two key mechanisms: the direct creation of jobs and the multiplier effect. Infrastructure projects require significant labor, thus directly increasing employment in construction, engineering, and related sectors. Moreover, this spending injects money into the economy, which, through the multiplier effect, results in increased consumption and investment as the initial expenditure circulates. This chain reaction stimulates further economic activity, boosting overall output and employment in the short term.

2. Long-Term Effects on Economic Growth and Living Standards Over the long term, the completion of new and enhanced infrastructure has the potential to significantly boost economic growth and elevate living standards. Efficient infrastructure - including transportation systems, utilities, and communication networks - underpins economic activity by facilitating the movement of goods, services, and information. Improved infrastructure can reduce costs for businesses, enhance productivity, and open up new markets, thereby fostering economic growth. Additionally, such developments can directly improve living standards by providing better access to essential services, reducing commute times, and increasing the overall quality of life for the general population.

3. Impact on GDP Components The increase in government spending (G) on infrastructure impacts other components of GDP, namely Consumption (C), Investment (I), Exports (X), and Imports (M). An increase in G can lead to an increase in C, as employment and income levels rise, boosting consumer spending. However, there might be a crowding-out effect on private investment (I), particularly if increased government spending leads to higher interest rates. The impact on exports (X) and imports (M) is more nuanced. Improved infrastructure can enhance a country's export competitiveness, potentially increasing X. Conversely, infrastructure projects often require imported materials and expertise, which may increase M, at least in the short term.

4. Keynesian View on Government Spending and Aggregate Demand From a Keynesian perspective, increased government spending is a vital tool for stimulating aggregate demand, especially during economic downturns. According to this theory, government spending can compensate for decreased private sector demand, thereby preventing or mitigating recessions. Increased government expenditure raises aggregate demand, which in turn stimulates consumption and production. This chain reaction leads to an increase in economic activity and can accelerate recovery from recessions, as the economy benefits from the injection of government funds into the market.

5. State-Level Impact The impact of increased infrastructure spending at the state level varies depending on several factors, including the state's economic structure, existing infrastructure, and the specific nature of the investments. States with significant infrastructure projects may experience immediate benefits in terms of job creation and improved public services. In the long term, these states can enjoy enhanced economic growth due to better connectivity and efficiency. The degree to which an individual state benefits from such spending depends on how well the projects are executed and how closely they align with the state's specific economic needs and capabilities.

Conclusion In summary, increased infrastructure spending plays a critical role in both short-term economic stimulation and long-term economic growth. While it directly boosts employment and output in the short term, its long-term benefits include enhanced economic efficiency, higher living standards, and sustained growth. The Keynesian economic theory underscores the importance of such spending, especially during economic downturns, as a means to boost aggregate demand and foster economic recovery. At the state level, the impact of this spending is contingent upon various factors, including the nature of the projects and the state's economic context. Ultimately, strategic infrastructure investment is a key component of economic policy, with wide-ranging implications for the health and stability of the economy.","Assuming you are an economic student well versed in economics at a high level, write me a paper, that answers these questions below. 1.

Elliott's experiment, conducted in 1968, was a response to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and aimed to teach her students about the arbitrary and hurtful nature of discrimination.

The experiment divided Elliott's class into two groups based on an arbitrary characteristic: eye color. On the first day, Elliott designated the blue-eyed children as the superior group. They were given extra privileges, treated more kindly, and were told they were smarter and better than the brown-eyed children. The brown-eyed children were treated as inferior: they were criticized more harshly, given fewer privileges, and subjected to discriminatory behavior from both Elliott and their blue-eyed peers.

The effects of this experiment were profound and immediate. The blue-eyed children, basking in their newfound superiority, became domineering, bossy, and insensitive to their brown-eyed classmates. Their academic performance improved significantly. In contrast, the brown-eyed children became timid, anxious, and their academic performance suffered. They seemed to internalize the belief of their inferiority.

The next day, Elliott reversed the roles. Now the brown-eyed children were deemed superior. The same effects were observed but in reverse: the now-superior brown-eyed children exhibited similar negative behaviors as the blue-eyed group had the day before, and the blue-eyed children experienced a downturn in their confidence and academic performance.

Elliott's experiment was a vivid demonstration of the rapid and intense effects that discrimination can have on behavior and self-perception. It showed how easily people can accept a biased system and how quickly they can adopt discriminatory attitudes towards others, even when the basis for discrimination is as arbitrary as eye color.

The point Elliott was trying to get across was the insidious nature of discrimination and how it can be ingrained into society, affecting the attitudes, behavior, and performance of those who are subjected to it. She conveyed this message through the direct and visceral experience of the children in her class. They were not merely told about discrimination; they lived through it, felt its impact, and saw its arbitrariness. This approach made the lessons of the experiment far more impactful and enduring than any lecture or textbook could.

Elliott's experiment remains a powerful reminder of the dangers of discrimination and the ease with which it can be absorbed and perpetuated within society. It underscores the importance of education and awareness in combating prejudiced attitudes and fostering a more equitable and empathetic society.","I used ChatGPT and gave specific instructions to "" Assume you are a scholar writing your feedback about this video."""

5526,1- Entirely written by me,"* In the short run, will increased infrastructure spending stimulate employment and economic output?Why?

Yes, increased infrastructure would lead to increased employment and economic output in the short run.This however depends on a few things.Strategic investment in areas that would get the best results.This means that the infrastructure spending should be focused on getting money into the hands of individuals who would use it immediately and not save or pay off debts.Example: A young man employed on the new road projects would use his paycheck to buy groceries, pay rent, and other household items (Consumption).This in turn allows the supermarket where he shops to hire employees and purchase more goods from manufacturing companies, who in turn can keep paying employees on the production line (The multiplier effect).

It will also depend on how fast the local and state governments can get these projects underway.""When the federal government appropriates money to infrastructure spending, two effects limit how quickly and how effectively federal aid becomes productive public infrastructure: (1) state-and-local government infrastructure spending offsets and (2) the time needed to complete the infrastructure investment.""Still, most estimates of the output ""multiplier""for infrastructure investment are substantially higher than for other fiscal interventions

What about the long run, after all the new infrastructure is completed?What will the likely long-run effects of improved and expanded infrastructure be on economic growth and living standards?

Theoretically an increase in government spending can stimulate the economy in both the short and long run.Again, it all depends on a few factors.On the other hand, there can be some negative effects of increase government spending, like crowding out and inflation.One of the most common forms of crowding out takes place when a large government, such as that of the U.S., increases its borrowing and sets in motion a chain of events that results in the curtailing of private sector spending.""The sheer scale of this type of borrowing can lead to substantial rises in the real interest rate, which has the effect of absorbing the economy's lending capacity and of discouraging businesses from making capital investments.""

An increase in government spending can also increase the interest on loans firms would need to fund projects.Therefore, they would need to borrow more money to yield the same profits.I've read that many economists disagree on the positive and negative effects of increase infrastructure spending has on the economy.One of the points raised was the fact that the government must borrow these funds therefore increasing the debt ceiling which will have a negative impact on the economy in the long run.

how do you think the increase in G will affect other components of GDP i.e., changes in C, I, X and/or M?Do explain.

Government spending leads to a significant increase in consumption.As I explained above, whether it is through increased infrastructure spending or other stimulus, the money injected into the economy coupled with the multiplier effect encourages consumption of goods and services.This is especially true when this money falls into the hands of those who need it the most and spend it immediately.

""According to Keynesian economics, increased government spending raises aggregate demand and increases consumption, which leads to increased production and faster recovery from recessions.""

Government spending can reduce saving in the, as a result can potentially increase interest rates.Because of higher interest rates there may be less investments in areas that may increase productivity in the economy.

Since an immediate effect of increase government spending is an increase in production it may also increase exports and imports.Since some of the goods needed to produce some products domestically can only be obtained from foreign countries, firms may need to purchase more of these goods to manufacture goods locally for the demand in consumption.However, "" The demand by foreigners for our exports depends on their national income, but it is independent of our domestic national income.""

Due to the increase in government spending the aggregate demand curve shifts right because there is a positive increase in the factor's affective growth.Also, he ""aggregate demand curve tends to shift to the left when total consumer spending declines.""Because this is not the case in this scenario, we can see that the curve shifts to the right.",Economics,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,0,May Have AI,66.67,0.04,27.49,,

The Limitations of Language in Understanding the Universe

Language, a remarkable tool for communication, shapes and constrains the way we perceive and comprehend the universe. This essay explores the inherent limitations of language in capturing the vastness, complexity, and nuances of the cosmos.



Language is inherently ambiguous, leading to potential misunderstandings and misinterpretations. In scientific discourse, precision is crucial, yet the imprecise nature of language can hinder our ability to convey complex ideas accurately. The universe, with its intricate phenomena, often defies easy description, exposing the inadequacy of language.



Abstract concepts such as those found in quantum physics, metaphysics, and philosophy pose a unique challenge for language. The limitations become evident when attempting to articulate ideas beyond the tangible realm, where words may fall short in encapsulating the true depth of these concepts.



Language is deeply entwined with culture, and cultural biases embedded in language can influence our worldview. Concepts that exist in one language may lack direct equivalents in another, shaping our understanding of the universe through a cultural and linguistic lens. This introduces limitations in cross-cultural communication and the transfer of scientific knowledge.



Our understanding of time is fundamentally influenced by the language we use. Languages differ in their treatment of temporal concepts, affecting how individuals perceive and discuss time-related phenomena. This linguistic influence can impede a unified understanding of temporal aspects in the universe.



Language is not static; it evolves alongside our understanding of the world. However, this evolution is gradual, and the language we have may struggle to keep pace with rapid advancements in scientific discovery. As a result, gaps may emerge between the scientific understanding of the universe and our ability to articulate that understanding effectively.



In conclusion, language, while a powerful tool, imposes limitations on our comprehension of the universe. The ambiguities, conceptual constraints, cultural biases, temporal influences, and the evolving nature of language collectively contribute to a gap between our perception and the true intricacies of the cosmos. Acknowledging these limitations prompts us to explore alternative modes of expression and communication to enhance our grasp of the universe's wonders.

1535,4- AI-generated,Write an essay about the fallacy of speed.,Technology,300 or 400 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,93,May Have AI,66,0.03,54.24,"The Fallacy of Speed



In the ever-accelerating pace of the modern world, the concept of speed has become a prevailing force shaping various aspects of our lives. From technological advancements to daily routines, the pursuit of speed is often hailed as a symbol of progress and efficiency. However, this essay seeks to unravel the fallacy embedded within society's unbridled obsession with speed. By examining its impact on mental well-being, interpersonal relationships, and the environment, we will explore the hidden costs that accompany the relentless push for rapidity.



In the technological era, the relentless pursuit of speed is most evident in the breakneck pace of innovation. The rapid development of new technologies promises convenience and efficiency but often neglects the profound consequences on human well-being. The constant need for software updates, faster devices, and instantaneous communication contributes to a culture of perpetual urgency. The fallacy lies in the assumption that speed equates to progress. While technological advancements undoubtedly bring about transformative changes, the unexamined pursuit of speed in this context can lead to a cycle of perpetual dissatisfaction. The demand for faster processors, quicker response times, and immediate access to information fosters an environment where individuals are incessantly chasing the next upgrade, neglecting the value of stability and contemplation.



The fallacy of speed extends beyond the realm of technology and permeates into the fabric of our mental well-being. The constant bombardment of information, coupled with the pressure to keep up, contributes to a heightened state of stress and anxiety. The expectation for immediate responses, quick decision-making, and the ability to multitask creates a culture that often prioritizes speed over thoughtfulness. In this context, the fallacy lies in the assumption that increased speed equates to enhanced productivity. Research suggests that the relentless pursuit of speed can lead to burnout, decreased creativity, and impaired decision-making abilities. The mind, under constant pressure to operate at maximum velocity, may sacrifice depth for rapidity, compromising the quality of thought and reflection. Moreover, the societal glorification of busyness perpetuates the fallacy of speed. Individuals often measure their worth by their level of activity and the speed at which they navigate through their daily lives. This mentality not only fosters a sense of inadequacy for those unable to keep up but also undermines the importance of leisure, relaxation, and the slower rhythms of life.



As the world hurtles forward, interpersonal relationships are not immune to the fallacy of speed. The advent of social media, with its instantaneous connectivity, has transformed the dynamics of human interaction. While it allows for quick communication and the sharing of experiences, it also fosters a culture of instant gratification and superficial connections. The fallacy here is rooted in the belief that the speed of communication equates to the depth of connection. Relationships, both personal and professional, require time, investment, and genuine engagement. The constant need for rapid responses and the ephemeral nature of online interactions can undermine the development of meaningful connections. In the pursuit of speed, the value of face-to-face conversations, empathetic listening, and the cultivation of deep, lasting bonds often takes a backseat. Additionally, the fallacy of speed in relationships manifests in the pressure to conform to societal timelines. Whether it be the rush to achieve relationship milestones or the expectation of immediate success in personal endeavors, the accelerated pace set by societal norms can hinder the organic growth of relationships. The result is often a sense of unfulfillment and the erosion of the authentic, gradual development of connections.



The fallacy of speed also extends to our relationship with the environment. The pursuit of economic growth and industrial progress has often come at the cost of environmental sustainability. Rapid industrialization, fueled by the demand for faster production and consumption, has led to the depletion of natural resources, environmental degradation, and climate change. The fallacy lies in the assumption that speed in economic development is synonymous with prosperity. The disregard for the environment in the pursuit of rapid economic growth is unsustainable and jeopardizes the very foundation upon which human civilization depends. The depletion of resources, pollution, and the degradation of ecosystems are the hidden costs of the fallacy of speed, challenging the notion that relentless acceleration is a sustainable path forward.



In light of the multifaceted impact of the fallacy of speed, it becomes imperative to reevaluate our societal priorities. The unquestioned pursuit of rapidity, whether in technological innovation, daily routines, interpersonal relationships, or economic growth, demands critical examination. Firstly, acknowledging that speed is not an intrinsic measure of progress is crucial. Progress should be assessed based on the well-being of individuals, the sustainability of our environment, and the depth of our connections. A more balanced and nuanced approach that considers the long-term consequences of speed is essential for fostering a healthier and more sustainable society. Secondly, embracing the value of slowness is pivotal in challenging the fallacy of speed. Cultivating mindfulness, encouraging thoughtful decision-making, and savoring the present moment can counteract the detrimental effects of a constantly accelerated pace. The pursuit of quality over quantity, depth over superficiality, and sustainability over rapid consumption can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence. Moreover, reassessing societal norms and expectations is paramount. Redefining success and well-being in terms of a more holistic understanding, rather than conforming to the pressures of speed-driven benchmarks, can foster a culture that prioritizes individual happiness, environmental sustainability, and authentic human connections.



In conclusion, the fallacy of speed permeates every facet of modern life, promising progress but often delivering unintended consequences. From the relentless push for technological advancement to the toll on mental well-being, interpersonal relationships, and the environment, the hidden costs of speed are profound. It is imperative to recognize that speed is not an intrinsic indicator of success or well-being. By reevaluating our societal priorities, embracing the value of slowness, and challenging the norms that perpetuate the fallacy of speed, we can pave the way for a more balanced, sustainable, and fulfilling existence. The journey towards a more thoughtful, reflective, and sustainable future begins with a collective reexamination of our relationship with speed and a conscious effort to navigate the complexities of modern life with intention and purpose.

Secular Concert Assessment

The concert event titled Arthur Honegger's King David, performed by Rutgers' very own Kirkpatrick choir, was a musical performance involving the original orchestration of Arthur Hoennger and segments of exposition to facilitate the audience's understanding of the famous tale of King David. The story is in the Book of Samuel, a book in the Hebrew Bible, and the old Christian Testament. The story's presence in both Judaism and Christianity aligns with the historical information presented in Guy L. Beck's book titled Sacred Sound. Christianity was conceived after the collapse of the second temple thus it is rooted in second temple Judaism which results in the religions sharing many hymns and stories. The story begins with David assisting Israel's first king, Saul, in the conflict against the Philistines. David's great achievement in the conflict garnered him fame that surpassed Saul's resulting in Saul growing quite jealous. Saul plotted to have David killed but he fled. During that time, Saul was slain in battle and David became king. The most well-known aspect of King David's life is his battle with the mighty Goliath where he rejected King Saul's battle tactics and faced the behemoth Goliath alone with only a slingshot in hand and faith in God. King David's life is recounted to teach religious practitioners numerous lessons such as don't judge a person by their appearance, what is thought to be impossible can be done, and never forgetting about god.



Honegger's music is undoubtedly influenced by his experience in the Protestant church as a young boy. In the Protestant church, he was exposed to the works of the famous German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and later in life, in works such as King David, his admiration for Bach was evident through ""‚ÄòBachian' counterpoint and chorale-like melodies''(Leonard). Honegger's religious beliefs are said to be extremely formative in his musical career which resulted in the ""Bible being a constant source of inspiration for his music""(Leonard). On the other hand, Rutgers' Kirkpatrick choir has no religious affiliation. The choir was not outfitted in any sort of religious garments and the performance did not evoke any feelings of religion in the same way a worship service would. The performance was led by a conductor and members of an orchestra were present. As the members of the choir performed their passion for the music was evident on their faces but it was not to the same level of passion displayed by the gospel singers such as Thomas Dorsey. I attribute this to the emotional power of religion. Religion can drive people to extremes such as monastic monks that do not engage in listening to music because it goes against their religious beliefs. The lack of ""religious passion""did not hinder the performance but it was a factor in the event feeling secular.



Although the concert felt secular as a spectator, the songs undeniably contained religious content. One segment of the concert, in particular, March of the Philistines, involved the orchestra and a speaker recounting a chapter in the story of King David. The music being played by the orchestra reminded me of early Disney animations that included no voice acting but still mastered the projection of emotion through an orchestral unit. The sound seemed to perfectly encapsulate the feeling of a march of soldiers into conflict. While sitting in the audience, I was able to picture a cartoonish march of the enemy which was facilitated by the orchestra's masterful performance. After the orchestra halted their playing, a speaker began to read directly from the story of King David. Reading the story the speaker stated, ""A malachite messenger brought to David the crown and bracelet of Saul‚Ä¶ and he mourned and wept for the people of the Lord and the house of Israel.""The orchestra's foreboding and dangerous sound transitions perfectly to David learning of the death of King Saul at the hand of the Philistines. Another segment of the concert, titled Song of the Prophets, was more reliant on the choir compared to the March of the Philistines. Choir music always reminds me of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I deeply love; so hearing the beautiful meshing of multiple vocals into a pure sound is always pleasant. The lyrics were difficult to make out but I believe the song stated, ""Whichever way he turn, a path he must pursue.""The choirs' elongation of the ending of lines in the song makes the song feel more sacred and the prophetical lyrics reminded me of Greek mythology where protagonists are often presented with prophecies by oracles. The lyrics reference David's destiny of being King as he was selected by God to succeed Saul. These lyrics contain ever-present religious themes such as God's control over the destiny of his devout followers. The inclusion of important religious messages throughout the concert highlights the purpose of many stories and songs in religion which would be to educate. Again, the contents of this segment of the concert are religious and deal directly with the story of King David; but, it did not feel religious.

Before attending the concert, I did not expect religious fervor to be present amongst the audience or choir due to the circumstances of the event. The professionalized setting of the concert made it feel distant from religion. After experiencing the concert I can say the concert did not feel overtly religious even though the musical content of the performance is rooted in religion. Religion is present throughout the performance because psalms such as in the Lord I put my faith, o, had I wings like a dove, pity me Lord, and more were performed. The other content of the performance involves telling the tale of King David which is religious yet still, the audience did not seem to be experiencing religion; instead, it felt the same as an audience that would be consuming a broadway play. I think that part of this is a result of the reason that the audience is there. When a person attends a religious service they are going to express their faith and experience spirituality. For example, many religions native to Africa involve services encompassing rituals that involve a person passionately performing with the religious community and then becoming possessed. The goal of the ritual is to grow closer to God and this is facilitated by the ritual. This concept is present in most other religions where rituals are performed as a community or individually to have an experience that places the practitioner closer to God. A person attending a religious service is simply in a different headspace compared to a concertgoer. The average concert goer is more of a spectator and not as involved in the experience compared to a worshiper in a Church. Many spectators seemed to be present in the audience to consume the entertainment, the musical performance, similar to how one goes to see a movie. The audience did not seem affected by the performance on a spiritual level but I think it would devalue the performance of the musicians to claim that the secularization of the religious piece detracted from the overall performance. Performance does not have to be religious to be enjoyable. The choir's vocal performance was excellent, astronomically better than my middle school's choir which is the only other live choir listening experience I have undergone. Normally, the music that I consume involves vocals that are musically engineered using auto-tune which results in great music but listening to a choir performing purely with their voices is a refreshing experience. Choir musicians can be considered the pinnacle of human vocal ability so experiencing a live performance was special. The instrumentalists were also fabulous which complimented and elevated the performance. Overall, the concert was a great musical experience.

The Satanic Verses Review

The Satanic Verses, by Salman Rushdie, was published in 1988 by Viking Penguin in the United Kingdom. Upon its release, the book gained infamy for its alleged blasphemy regarding its depiction of Islam and the prophet Muhammed. A fatwa was issued that sent Rushdie into hiding and targeted many related to the publication of the novel such as publishers and translators. The Japanese translator of the book was assassinated and his death has yet to be solved. The fatwa hangs over Rushdie almost 30 years later as Rushdie was recently attacked by a young muslim leaving him blind in one eye. The controversy surrounding the novel is what initially drove me to read it but as I progressed further and further in the book I was left confused as the book was not overtly blasphemous but instead an imaginative discussion of religion and the human experience. The novel focuses on two men, Saladin Chamcha and Gibreel Farishta, that are involved in a plane crash and reborn, Gibreel as an archangel and Chamcha as the devil growing goatish features like horns and hooves. Gibreel's mental state spirals downward throughout the whole novel as he begins to have dreams in which he is the archangel Gibreel, the name referencing the angel Gabriel. One dream involves the retelling of the founding of Islam and is centered around a character named Mahound and another dream parallels the story of Jesus. Chamcha's life after his rebirth goes wrong. He is abused by police, turns into a hideous goat-man hybrid, and his wife cheats on him with his friend. The story revolves around the two men in London set on a collision course where they eventually meet towards the end of the novel. The novel was a brilliant work, Rushdie created an immersive world with elements of magical realism interlaced with several subplots. I think the beauty of the novel is that it provokes grand ideas essential to the human experience. One example is when the narrator states, ""What is the opposite of faith?... Not disbelief. Too final, certain, closed. Itself a kind of belief. No, the opposite of faith is doubt. (Rushdie, 178)""The Satanic Verses challenges the notion of a binary conceptualization of good and evil and instead theorizes that good and evil are an innate aspect of the human experience, to be human is to be good and evil.



The two main characters of the novel are Saladin Chamcha, a diasporic Indian living in London, who has a strong distaste for India and its culture due to his experiences as a youth in Mumbai and the other is Gibreel Farishta, a Bollywood star popular for playing the role of deities on film. Both board a flight to London that is hijacked by terrorists and falls from the sky. Both characters are reborn, Gibreel as an archangel and Chamcha as a devil. This is where the novel begins its discussion of good and evil. The angel, Gibreel, is seen as benevolent and a good person so Gibreel is treated well by others. On the other hand, Chamcha, the devil, is detained by British police and experiences many misfortunes. Rushdie strongly implies that this binary categorization of good and evil is incorrect through the characters Gibreel and Chamcha. Gibreel commits acts that would be categorized as ""evil""by the end of the novel while Chamcha makes amends with his estranged father in India. The novel also contends that evil is grounded in human nature and psychology; therefore, humans can be good and evil. Throughout his life, Saladin Chamcha attempted to assimilate into the culture of Englishness that he perceived to be ""good""in London but morphed into a representation of his idea of ""evil"". His transformation into a satyr reflects his psychology and the trauma he experienced. He viewed India as a place filled with ""rubber, litter, noise, and disorder,""so Saladin's satyr form is described as ""loud, stench, hideous, outsize, and grotesque.""During his time in India, Saladin had a traumatic experience with an old, Indian pedophile that revealed his ""flesh bone""which is reflected in Saladin's ""phallus, greatly enlarged and embarrassingly erect, (Rushdie, 205)""satyr form. During an argument with his father earlier in the novel, Saladin snaps at his father saying, ""Whatever I am, father dear‚Ä¶.I owe it all to you. (Rushdie, 53)""His father, Changez, is tall, so Saladin grows ""to a height over eight feet""(Rushdie, 223). Changez is superstitious so Saladin seeks help from a Moroccan priest to return to human form. Saladin appears to be ""the incarnation of evil""however he does not represent a universal evil but the evils specific to his human experience that have traumatized his psyche. When Changez is dying of cancer towards the end of the novel, Saladin comes to know the true nature of evil. Upon spending time with his dying father he states, ""(the cancer) stripped him of his faults, of all that had been domineering, tyrannical, and cruel in him, so that the mischievous, loving and brilliant man beneath lay exposed, once again, for all to see.(Rushdie, 442)""Just as Saladin's bodily metamorphosis emphasized the ""evil""in him, his father's cancer exposed the ""good"". Chamcha and his father reflect the central theme of the novel, how the human experience leads one to be ""good""or ""evil""and that anyone has the capacity for either.



Rushdie uses many Hindu, Arabic, and Urdu phrases which can leave the reader feeling confused and as somewhat of an outsider. I believe that this is purposeful to reflect the experience of immigrants in London, the story's main setting, who feel like outsiders. Rushdie himself explains his use of vocabulary that readers may not be familiar with saying, "" I use them as flavoring. I mean, I can read books from America and I don't always get the slang‚Ä¶It's fun to read things when you don't know all the words. Even children love it. One of the things any great children's writer will tell you is that children like it if in books designed for their age group, there is a vocabulary just slightly bigger than theirs. So they come up against weird words, and the weird words excite them.""One word that comes to mind when I think of Rushdie's writing style would be fun. The sequence in which Gibreel is free falling after terrorists blow up his plane showcases Rushdie's playfulness, ""To be born again,' sang Gibreal Farishta tumbling from the heavens, 'first you have to die. Ho ji! Ho ji! To land upon the bosomy earth, first one needs to fly Tat-taa! Takatun! How to ever smile again, if first you won't cry? How to win the darling's love mister, without a sigh?(Rushdie, 1)""Another word I would use to describe the novel at the start would be difficult. Rushdie's writing style was challenging to engage with at the start. Sentences ran along for a while and some punctuation was different than what I am used to. But, despite these minor critiques, the story of the novel is immersive and gets the reader to empathize with the characters. I found myself rooting for the romance between Gibreel and Ally Cone to be successful and when Rushdie magnified cracks in the relationship I almost wanted to put the book down but I persevered. The novel did not fail to elicit emotional reactions from me. Rushdie's style was one of the most unique I have encountered and greatly effective in immersing the reader into the world and characters.



Many critics of the novel find it to be blasphemous; however, throughout my reading and even after reading, I found that the novel was a catalyst for introspection. The novel highlighted the relationship between the human experience and their perception of good and evil so I thought of my own life and how many experiences have shaped my views of the two words. The substory dealing with Mahound was very successful in getting me to think about my worldviews and compromise. I thought it was very courageous for someone to offer a retelling of the founding of Islam where Mahound, representing Mahommed, made compromises to further his own goals. Mahound agreed to accept three gods even though he previously told his followers the angel Gibreel had told him there was only one god. We later find out that when Gibreel is visited by Mahound, he loses control of himself and feels Mahound's will dominating his body and imposing his desires onto Gibreel who then vocalizes them to Mahound. Every human has experienced cognitive dissonance so linking it to our perceptions of religion was thought-provoking. Reading the novel made me feel like a child interacting with a fantastical world or characters but also like a philosopher trying to tackle grand ideas. I still have many thoughts about particular aspects of the novel. I have not fully come to understand Gibreel's character and the meaning of his religious visions and the character of Ayesha is also a mystery. This novel had many goals, giving voice to the immigrant experience in London, discussing Indian identity, challenging the binary notion of good and evil, and compromise versus faith. The work is one of my favorites and I would highly recommend it to anyone willing to take on the challenge.",

This initiative aligns economic motives with environmental goals, fostering a market-driven mechanism to address carbon emissions' externalities.

Proponents argue that a carbon tax promotes economic efficiency, encouraging innovation and sustainable practices. The attached financial consequence motivates businesses to explore cleaner technologies, leading to long-term economic and environmental benefits. Generated revenue could fund renewable energy projects and climate change initiatives.

However, critics express concerns about the economic burden, fearing potential job losses and increased costs. The challenge lies in finding a balance between environmental responsibility and economic stability.

Environmental groups strongly favor a carbon tax as a critical tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing moral responsibility and urgency in addressing climate change.

Conversely, those in the fossil fuel industry oppose a carbon tax, fearing economic downturns and job losses. Their resistance stems from a genuine concern for their economic well-being.

Business leaders in renewable energy generally support a carbon tax, seeing it as a means to level the playing field for sustainable sources and stimulate innovation. Their perspective is rooted in economic interests and the profitability of renewable technologies.

It's recommended that the President supports a national carbon tax, given its potential to reduce emissions, generate revenue for green initiatives, and foster economic incentives for innovation. Success hinges on strategic communication, emphasizing long-term benefits for both the environment and the economy. Building a coalition inclusive of environmentalists, business leaders, and renewable energy advocates is paramount for effective policy implementation.

The urgency of climate action cannot be overstated. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and escalating environmental degradation underscore the need for decisive measures. The carbon tax addresses the root cause of climate change- carbon emissions- by discouraging excessive emissions and encouraging investment in cleaner alternatives.

The economic efficiency argument, put forth by proponents, is compelling. Businesses, driven by the profit motive, are more likely to innovate and adopt sustainable practices when faced with a direct financial consequence for emitting carbon.

Moreover, the revenue generated from the carbon tax has the potential to become a powerful tool for environmental investment. Funding renewable energy projects, supporting research and development in green technologies, and bolstering climate change adaptation initiatives are all feasible outcomes. This revenue could be a transformative force, driving a transition towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

Understanding the diverse perspectives on this issue is crucial for effective policymaking. Environmental groups, with their focus on moral responsibility and the urgency of climate action, are likely to be strong advocates. Conversely, those in the fossil fuel industry, fearing economic downturns and job losses, will resist. The human impact of these policy decisions is evident in the genuine concern of workers in these industries for their economic well-being.

In conclusion, the recommendation for the President to support a national carbon tax is grounded in the potential benefits for both the environment and the economy. Strategic communication, emphasizing long-term gains, is essential. Building a coalition that spans environmentalists, business leaders, and renewable energy advocates is the key to successful policy implementation. The U.S. has a unique opportunity to lead the global fight against climate change, and implementing a carbon tax can be a decisive step towards a more sustainable and resilient future.","ChatGPT 3.5: ""Can you write me an essay that looks like it was written by a human with the following prompt?"""

This period witnessed profound changes in the lives of working people across the nation and new immigrants. Amidst the shifting economic and political landscape, workers sought to build collective power as a means to better their job conditions and assert agency over their lives and work. This essay explores the various strategies employed by working people, evaluates their effectiveness, and delves into the factors that limited their ability to collectively build power within the broader social, economic, and political context of the time.

The economic and political context of the late 19th century was characterized by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the overall expansion of the nation's economy. Despite the economic crisis in the 1890s, the United States experienced tremendous growth, creating new opportunities and challenges for the working class. The shift from agrarian economies to industrial capitalism marked a significant change in the nature of work, impacting both urban and rural areas and workers across various industries.

In response to these changes, working people across the nation sought to adapt and improve their conditions through collective action. One of the primary strategies employed was the formation of labor unions. These unions became a formidable force, advocating for workers' rights, better wages, and improved working conditions. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) emerged as a prominent example, focusing on skilled workers and collective bargaining as a means to achieve tangible improvements.

Strikes and protests were also key tools in the arsenal of working people. The Pullman Strike of 1894 stands out as a poignant example of workers demanding better conditions and fair wages. Strikes served not only as a direct action to assert workers' rights but also as a means to garner public support and draw attention to the struggles of the working class.

Political activism was another avenue through which working people sought to influence change. Engaging in the political process, workers advocated for policies that would benefit their interests. This included the emergence of labor-oriented political parties and the active participation of the working class in shaping legislative changes that addressed their concerns.

Despite these efforts, factors limited the working people's ability to collectively build power. Opposition from industrialists and employers, who perceived collective bargaining as a threat to their interests, posed a significant challenge. The influence of powerful business magnates on shaping governmental policies often worked against the interests of the working class.

Government response to labor movements and strikes played a crucial role. While some administrations were more sympathetic to workers' demands, others took a more adversarial stance, deploying military and legal measures to quell strikes. The influence of political ideologies further shaped the government's response to the labor movements of the time.

Social and cultural barriers also played a role in limiting the collective power of working people. Societal attitudes towards workers' movements and the treatment of different groups of workers varied, impacting the success of collective actions. Cultural biases often affected how certain immigrant groups were treated in the workforce, adding an additional layer of complexity to the struggles of the working class.

In conclusion, the working people of the late 19th century navigated a complex landscape marked by economic growth and challenges. Their adaptive strategies, including the formation of labor unions, strikes, and political activism, were crucial in influencing change. However, opposition from industrialists, government responses, and social barriers presented formidable challenges. The effectiveness of these strategies varied, but collectively they laid the groundwork for the labor movements of the 20th century, shaping the ongoing struggle for workers' rights. The legacy of their efforts reverberates in the continued fight for fair labor practices and social justice today.","ChatGPT 3.5: ""Can you write me an essay that looks like it was written by a human with the following prompt?"""

Carbon is mainly discharged through the combustion of fossil fuels. A carbon tax can be a tax that is based on the number of tons of carbon that is emitted in the air. The main purpose of placing a price on carbon emissions is to incentivize producers and consumers to look for more energy friendly alternatives that will help the environment. Since producers would want to avoid paying taxes as much as possible, they would look to use cleaner energy and use their energy more efficiently. For the companies that would continue to emit carbon, that revenue can be used for climate mitigation programs. A carbon tax is not a foreign concept either considering that other countries have already implemented the tax. Low-income households however would be more affected than high-income households. This is because low-income households spend a larger portion of their budget on energy. Since a carbon tax would increase the price of energy, the tax would be regressive in the sense that low-income households would be disproportionately affected compared to high-income households.
An advantage of the carbon tax would be that it would help to raise a lot of revenue. According to Aldy, ""Most experts suggest a tax of around $25 per ton of CO2, which would raise approximately $125 billion annually""(Aldy 2012: 2). Another advantage would be that reducing the carbon emissions in the US would greatly reduce the number of emissions in the world as the United States is a huge emitter of carbon. In addition, companies would also be forced to look for cleaner and more energy efficient fuels than fossil fuels. It is possible for a carbon tax to also help our economy. Aldy says ""Reducing personal and corporate income taxes would promote growth because these taxes distort employment, savings, and investment. The $125 billion in annual revenues from a $25/ton carbon tax could allow federal personal income tax reductions of about 15 percent or corporate income tax reductions of about 70 percent, if all carbon tax revenues were used to replace current tax revenues. Alternatively, the federal deficit could be reduced by approximately $1.25 trillion over 10 years-about the same reduction that the 2011 Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction would have had to agree on to avoid mandatory spending cuts""(Aldy 2012: 3-4).
Some disadvantages of a carbon tax include that it can possible hurt the economy. ""A carbon tax could slightly reduce economy-wide employment due to lower demand for workers in carbon-intensive industries and weakened incentives for labor force participation (because the tax would lead to higher prices, reducing workers' buying power""(Aldy 2012: 3-4). This is basically saying that due to the carbon tax, there would be less demand for those workers in the carbon industries as companies would have to worry about the carbon tax and the wages of its employees. Another con could be the fact that reducing the emissions in the United States can lead to what is known as carbon leakage in other nations, Carbon leakage is when the reduction in emissions in a country leads to an increase in the number of emissions in other countries. This can be because carbon intensive goods would be more likely to move abroad to avoid the tax. ""Research finds that, on average, a 10 percent reduction in carbon emissions in the United States would be partially offset by a 1 to 3 percent increase elsewhere""(Aldy 2012: 7).
A group that would be affected by the carbon tax in a negative way would be low-income households. Low-income households would be disproportionately affected to compared high-income households. While low-income households spend less on energy, they spend a bigger portion of their budget on energy. According to Belsie, ""First, by linking the amount of carbon emissions from each industry to consumer expenditures by income group, the authors show that consumption differences explain the regressivity of a carbon tax. Assuming a levy of $15 per ton of carbon dioxide, which is in the range of current proposals in Congress, the authors calculate that the one-fifth of households at the bottom of the income distribution would spend an extra $325 a year. That is less than a third of what the one-fifth of households at the top of the income distribution would pay annually. However, households in the low-income group earn only one-tenth as much as those in the high-income group on average, so their burden relative to income would be almost four times higher""(Belsie). This just goes to show just how much low-income households would be affected. The tax is not fair in the sense that it will not affect high-income households in the same way. It may seem like a flat tax is fair, but in hindsight low-income households would see the tax as way more burdensome to them compared to the high-income households.",

They have a huge impact today as they were very effective over a century ago. They rose to fame starting in the late 19th century. We need to understand the history of labor unions in order to gain an understanding of the significant impact that they had on the workforce. Labor unions helped to bring workers together and made them feel collective power. Labor unions made it easy for skilled and unskilled workers to fight for a common cause. Workers were able to fight for their rights and negotiate about them with their employers. There were several ways in which working people adapted to the changing economic and political conditions in the U.S. but labor unions were by far the most successful strategy. Workers were able to improve their working conditions and lives because of labor unions.
  The most successful labor union is the Knights of Labor. This was a nationally organized labor union that pushed for diversity. The Knights of Labor had members from several different races and nationalities. The Knights of Labor did a great job in bringing skilled and unskilled workers together to fight for a common cause. The KOL organization was focused on taking power away from monopolists. The monopolists were referred to as ""parasites""(Rosenzweig & Lichtenstein 96). The Knights of Labor were focused on remaining a secret organization at first. They started off this way as they felt that it would be effective to avoid the public eye (Rosenzweig & Lichtenstein 94). The Knights of Labor were reluctant at first when it came to including women in the organization. However, they eventually fought for equal rights and equal pay for women in the workforce. On one hand you can say that the Knights of Labor excluded specific groups such as Chinese workers. For example, they promoted the Chinese Exclusion Act. Chinese immigrants were the scapegoats for workers being able to assimilate (Lecture Notes). In essence, the Knights of Labor stood for inclusivity but did not actually include everybody. However, they still had a great impact on a national level. Workers felt that they could come together and fight for a common cause. The organization brought people together in public spaces including balls, spaces, and parades. The Knights of Labor preached independence for American workers. The Knights of Labor encouraged so many workers to fight for an eight-hour workday (Rosenzweig & Lichtenstein 101). This was led by Albert Parsons who was a radical Republican during the Reconstruction Era. The Knights were involved in many campaigns and worked in conjunction with other labor unions. The organization became so big that it hit 350,000 members at one point in 1886 which was equivalent to 3% of the nation's nonagricultural workforce (Rosenzweig & Lichtenstein 101). The Knights of Labor played the biggest role in labor unions being the most successful strategy for working people to adapt to the changing conditions of the workforce.
  The Knights of Labor started to decline after the Haymarket affair. Police beatings and the shooting of the two unarmed workers in Chicago led to the protest in Haymarket Square. In Haymarket Square a bomb exploded in the crowd which ended up killing a police officer. As a result, the police shot into the crowd and killed a civilian and wounded others. While the person with the bomb is not known, there is a conspiracy theory which stats that one of the policeman actually had the bomb (Professor Williams). This could have been to intentionally turn the people against each other. It is very easy to blame the death of the policeman on anarchist leaders as the very idea they stand for is no government. What was supposed to be a peaceful rally ended turning into a violent and bloodshed event. The Haymarket incident left a bad taste on unions for people in the upper and middle class. They felt that labor unions posed as threats to society. This event led to the creation of other labor unions.
Another labor union that emerged was the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The AFL catered to skilled workers. The AFL grew in popularity due to its narrow focus. Some people felt that the Knights of Labor had too much of a broad focus and instead felt that they should go to labor unions that focused on smaller but more specific goals. AFL members had some leverage on their employers as due to their skills. For example, Patrick Henry McCarthy is an example of a skilled worker who benefited from the AFL. He organized a big council for which he ran for many years in San Franciso. Because of McCarthy, skilled workers enjoyed great wages and working conditions in the city (Rosenzweig & Lichtenstein 112). We can really see how the AFL was focused on making the lives of a specific group of people much better. They felt that it was more effective to focus on a smaller group as it was easier to cater their needs.",

How the American Revolution left an impact on the British Empire
----------------------------------------------------------------",Other,Other,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,86,Likely AI,89.58,51.58,100,"The Enduring Impact of the American Revolution on the British Empire

The American Revolution, a pivotal event in world history, not only transformed the American colonies into an independent nation but also left a profound and lasting impact on the British Empire. The loss of its thirteen North American colonies marked the beginning of a gradual decline in British imperial dominance, prompting significant shifts in its political, economic, and social dynamics.

Political Repercussions

The American Revolution challenged the very foundations of British imperial authority. The successful secession of the colonies demonstrated that imperial rule was not unassailable, emboldening other subject territories to question their relationship with the British Crown. This newfound spirit of independence fueled anti-colonial movements across the globe, ultimately leading to the decolonization of vast swathes of the British Empire in the 20th century.

Moreover, the American Revolution forced Britain to re-evaluate its imperial policies. The rigid, centralized approach that had characterized British rule was no longer sustainable, and the empire began to adopt a more flexible and decentralized approach to governance. This shift was evident in the granting of greater autonomy to its dominions and colonies, paving the way for the modern Commonwealth of Nations.

Economic Implications

The loss of the American colonies dealt a significant blow to the British economy. The colonies had been a vital source of raw materials and a lucrative market for British goods. Their independence disrupted established trade networks and forced Britain to seek new markets and sources of supply. This economic disruption, coupled with the costs of the war, contributed to a period of financial instability in Britain.

However, the American Revolution also spurred economic innovation and diversification within the British Empire. The loss of the American market incentivized British manufacturers to explore new markets and products, leading to advancements in industrial technology and the expansion of trade with other parts of the world. Additionally, the empire's focus shifted towards developing its own resources and industries, reducing its reliance on the Atlantic trade system.

Social Transformations

The American Revolution had a profound impact on British society, challenging traditional notions of authority and hierarchy. The success of the American Revolution, based on the principles of self-governance and individual liberty, inspired calls for broader political reforms in Britain. The movement for parliamentary reform gained momentum, leading to the gradual expansion of voting rights and the democratization of British politics.

Furthermore, the American Revolution's emphasis on individual rights and freedoms had a ripple effect on British society, leading to greater tolerance for dissent and a more open and inclusive society. The abolitionist movement gained traction, and the British government eventually outlawed slavery throughout its empire. The American Revolution's ideals of liberty and equality also influenced the development of social reform movements in Britain, such as the Chartist movement and the suffragette movement.

Conclusion

The American Revolution was a watershed moment in British history, marking the beginning of a gradual decline in its imperial dominance. The political, economic, and social repercussions of the revolution were far-reaching, transforming the British Empire from a rigid, centralized power to a more flexible and diverse entity. The American Revolution's legacy continues to resonate today, influencing the modern Commonwealth of Nations and shaping the global political landscape.",I said to make it 500 words and make it sound like a human wrote it
3285,1- Entirely written by me,How youth work in Malls across America,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by Human,1,Likely Human,40.43,0.04,3,"Youth in America often find themselves in labor due to a variety of reasons, whether it's to provide additional income for their families or to strive for financial independence. However, due to the economic disparities across the world, many sites offering youth employment cannot allocate enough funds to ensure a quality working environment. Here in New England, mall establishments are very successful due to a strong health of the economy, since New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have some of the highest GDPs in the United States. Before conducting my observations at a New England mall (Menlo Park Mall in Edison, NJ), I assumed that working conditions would be exceptional, not only because the mall has been well funded for over 70 years, but because it is composed of fashion and fast food retailers, which are genuinely safe. However, both Besen and Tannock seem to hold a negative stance on youth work in malls, stating harsh working conditions, stress, and interference with school or other responsibilities.

The Workers and Work:

For my observations, I decided to go to Menlo on a Saturday, since there would be more teenagers working due to an absence of school. I discovered that the majority of youth at the mall work in clothing, toy or shoe stores, and not in fast food. The age range seemed to be around 16-20, indicating they have the cognitive ability to exercise safe working measures. My thought process was that because teenagers are working at a mall, they would probably work at a store that has similar interests. For example, the shoe stores at the mall typically employed mostly males who were wearing Air Jordan 1s and Yeezys, which are very popular within the sneakerhead community. At places like Forever 21, mostly female workers who had shared deep knowledge of current fashion trends with customers. From my observations, these teenagers seem to be genuinely happy about their job and their tasks, and nowhere did it seem that they were uncomfortable. That is why when I read Tannock's article on Youth and Work in America, I was very surprised that he was detailing a huge number of stress among the workers and that they didn't enjoy their job: ""High stress levels are the most widespread complaint among young workers in Box Hill and Glenwood. Stress can be caused by many aspects of grocery and fast-food work: difficult relations with customers and managers; repetitive work tasks; low occupational status and small paychecks; continual workplace surveillance; and hot, greasy, and often dangerous work environments'' (Tannock 3). When he mentions ""High stress levels""as being the ""most widespread complaint among young workers"", I could see where he is coming from, because on busy days, it's challenging to maintain functionality and order, however, since I went on a saturday, the mall was pretty packed and I noticed the workers handling everything fine, and they seemed happy because, again, because of the interests of the store. But, when I observed the fast food restaurants, I noticed that there was some sort of stress, because there were a lot of orders. But the age range of the people working there seemed much older, around 30-50, most teenagers who would want to work in fast food would probably not want to in a mall, since there would be a lot of people ordering and thus a lot of stress.

Store Atmosphere:

Based on my observations, the working conditions are what you'd expect from a New England mall in New Jersey. Since a majority of wealthy people are concentrated here, malls like Menlo are able to afford safer working conditions and adequate pay, as well as bonuses. It looked safe, with no instruments that could cause injury, maybe a ladder to reach higher shelves but it's only used when someone is there to supervise. When Tannock was describing the conditions of the youth workplace, he said: ""It can also be physically dangerous:

Grocery and restaurant workers throughout North America face some of the highest risks of all occupational groups of being injured, attacked, or even killed on the job""(Tannock 2). Comparing that with what I saw in fast food at the restaurants, there was also high supervision and a lack of machines that would cause serious injury resulting in death. Another aspect of the store atmosphere has to be how the managers treat the workers. I wasn't able to observe how the managers were acting since they weren't present. Besen says the following about managers and how they treat their youth employees: ""Employers have a long history of exploiting divisions within the workforce, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, as well as age. The employers decide that they prefer to hire youth because they feel that they can pay them less, work them harder or exploit their youthful appearance, and adult and youth workers alike suffer""(Besen 18). When employers ""exploit divisions""in the workforce, it indicates that they don't care about their employees, which can lead to a lack of supervision, or ""pay[ing] them less"". At Menlo, I cannot say that this happens, but at the Dunkin Donuts in which I worked, the manager always complained about us and how he would replace us with older people who can be more responsible. I was reminded of this personal anecdote when I read this part of Besen's article, meaning that there is some truth to it.



In conclusion, malls in New England are wealthy enough to house ideal working conditions in which youth workers feel comfortable and safe performing their duties, in which they also seem to enjoy their work. Although there are many negatives in the workplace like discussed in the passages, my observations seem to prove the contrary.",
1740,1- Entirely written by me,How environmental justice works and instances of it happening across the globe,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,1,Likely Human,40.48,0.02,2,"Environmental Justice is a form of social justice where people of all backgrounds are involved in the development of environmental laws, regulations and policies, to ensure that everyone should face similar environmental living conditions. An environmental justice issue is when certain communities face more hardship (due to environmental factors) than others. One example is when poorer communities have to deal with more pollution and contaminants in their food and water, while people of wealthier backgrounds hardly have to face this issue. A possible cause for this is a lack of capital in impoverished communities to establish methods of providing cleaner necessities, or factories dumping their toxic waste there. Another example is the allocation of charity funds to certain locations, whether fighting environmental problems are taking place in richer areas or poor, maybe because it incentives more donations from wealthier communities and more publicity.

The Environmental Justice Atlas is just as the name suggests, a map of all environmental struggles across the globe. Its legend consists of the usual suspects like war, famine, deforestation, waste sites etc. The purpose of this atlas is to present a simple geographical visualization of the severity of certain issues going on in different countries. For example, different areas of Africa, like South Sudan, are plagued with war, and nearby Somalia is struggling with famine; these are displayed on the atlas. Originally, the project was started by a European company named Ejolt, but it's moderation has now expanded to over a dozen environmental justice organizations that contribute to its constant updates.





This first issue I came across was the Oil exploitation in Buliisa District of Uganda. In this region, a local Oil company known as Tullow Oil has started conflicts with the local people. The overall impact of this is threats to wildlife, added pollution and population displacement (abduction and murders). In 2004, Tullow had obtained licenses to settle in Uganda and plant oil reserves, potentially harming the environment and wildlife there. Tensions began once Tullow started to evacuate people out of their homes, because a promising oil reserve was located underneath their village. The government accused the people who stayed of illegal occupation, and during a protest regarding this issue, a group of around 30 men sent by presumably Tullow, started to attack them. Tullow also dumped human waste into rivers, contaminating the waters. The people causing the environmental problem are those working in Tullow, and the people who are demanding environmental and social justice are the inhabitants of Buliisa. The people who are protesting demand that they return to their homes, and that Tullow seal up their oil mines, and be held legally responsible for them dumping toxic waste into the local waterways and ecosystems. It might be possible for this to happen, because now there seems to be government intervention against Tullow. The connecting piece between this problem and the other struggles is that there can be many indirect problems caused from environmental injustice, in this case, the people living in Buliisa had their waterways and wildlife contaminated because of the actions of Tullow's oil mining and waste dump.



The second issue I looked at was another industrial and utility conflict located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In a poorer community, Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) has not met their quota with the Clean Air Act and has released dangerous chemicals in the air, which residents of Grays Ferry have complained about, and statistics show that cancer and asthma are developing rapidly in the area. As expected, many residents had protested for PES to be held accountable, and also for some government intervention to help cleanse the air and reimburse financial damage. The people responsible for this environmental issue is PES, and the people who are demanding environmental justice are the inhabitants of Philly. The demands for the protestors are that PES is held financially responsible for their damages, which are the air contamination, people's medical bills and waste cleanup. They also wish for the city council to not move forward with their plans of tax breaks for corporations polluting the air, like PES. It might be possible for people to be reconciled with their current practices of protesting, because PES has actually declared bankruptcy in some districts due to the protests. Some connections that can be made is how similar this issue is prevalent in other countries. Many people assume that because the US is a super power, they don't face environmental issues with companies like other countries might.



A final issue that I came across was located in China, specifically in the Yueyang and Xiaowu rivers in Boshan District, Shandong Province. A recent observation of the local people indicate that the water has been yellowing for the past couple of years, however, fish seem to be living in the water still, indicating that it's not too contaminated. However, the residents are complaining that only a few years ago, the water was so clean you could see through it. Possible causes are the local companies that are responsible for coal mining and oil extraction, and which they dump their waste in the nearby bodies of water. These are the people responsible for the environmental justice issues, and the people who are advocating for some time to be done are the local professors studying the water, who found an abnormal amount of ions in the water, and the locals. Demands that the locals are asking for is that the government intervene and stop these companies from dumping their waste into the rivers, which is the most probable cause of the yellowing. There don't seem to be many connecting struggles, other than it again involved companies dumping toxic waste, and those companies being primarily mining and oil related.



In conclusion, it is very important for people to get involved in environmental justice because it helps protect the only planet we can call home. I think that good progress is being made by the community, because when researching specific issues, there have been a lot of protests to keep the surrounding environment clean and/or safe for both people and animals. This initiative of the people shows that the majority do agree in climate change and environmental justice, and are willing to do something about it. I decided to choose the specific issues because they all had to do with oil, which even though it is a natural resource, its massive consumption leaves heavy consequences on us, and it shows with these examples I looked at. I think that the movements caused by companies' actions are enough to convince people to stand up and engage in environmental justice.",

Banneker's rhetorical strategies, including his establishment of a cordial tone, his use of common ground, and his invocation of the nation's foundational ideals, contribute to his ultimate goal of exposing Jefferson's hypocrisy and persuading him to reconsider his stance on slavery.

Banneker's letter is notable for its respectful and cordial tone. He begins by addressing Jefferson as ""Sir"" and expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to communicate with him. This sets a conciliatory tone and establishes a sense of common ground between the two men. Banneker also acknowledges Jefferson's role in the American Revolution and his commitment to the ideals of liberty and equality. This appeal to Jefferson's own principles serves to disarm him and make him more receptive to Banneker's arguments.

Banneker's use of common ground is evident throughout the letter. He reminds Jefferson of the shared experiences of the American Revolution, a time when both black and white Americans fought for freedom. He also appeals to Jefferson's sense of justice and fairness, arguing that slavery is a violation of the fundamental principles of the American experiment.

Banneker's most powerful rhetorical strategy is his invocation of the nation's foundational ideals. He quotes from the Declaration of Independence, reminding Jefferson of his own words: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" Banneker's use of this language is particularly striking, as it forces Jefferson to confront the hypocrisy of his own position.

Banneker's rhetorical strategies are effective in exposing Jefferson's hypocrisy and persuading him to reconsider his stance on slavery. His respectful tone and appeal to common ground disarm Jefferson and make him more receptive to Banneker's arguments. His invocation of the nation's foundational ideals forces Jefferson to confront the contradiction between his own words and his actions.

Banneker's approach is significant in the context of the tensions between American ideals and the harsh realities of the time. While the ideals of liberty and equality were enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, the reality of slavery was a stark contradiction to these ideals. Banneker's letter is a powerful reminder of the need to reconcile the nation's ideals with its actions.

In conclusion, Benjamin Banneker's letter to Thomas Jefferson is a masterful example of rhetorical persuasion. Banneker's careful use of language and his appeal to Jefferson's own ideals make his argument for the abolition of slavery both compelling and persuasive. Banneker's letter is a reminder of the power of words to challenge injustice and promote change.","Write a detailed and specific summary of the following website: https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-22-02-0049

In George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece, ""1984,"" the characters of Winston Smith and Julia represent two distinct approaches to rebellion against the oppressive regime of Ingsoc. While Winston's rebellion is fueled by a deep-seated intellectual idealism, Julia's resistance stems from a more instinctual desire for personal freedom and sensual pleasure. Through their contrasting motivations and behavioral patterns, Orwell highlights the complexity of resistance in a totalitarian society, exposing the limitations of both ideological and individualistic approaches to rebellion.

Winston's rebellion is rooted in a profound disdain for Ingsoc's oppressive control over thought, history, and individual expression. He yearns for a world of genuine freedom, where truth and beauty are not distorted by the Party's propaganda machine. His diary, a symbol of his defiance, serves as a sanctuary where he can express his true thoughts and feelings, free from the Party's watchful eye. Winston's rebellion is intellectual, driven by a desire to restore a sense of historical authenticity and personal integrity.

Julia, on the other hand, approaches rebellion from a more personal and instinctive standpoint. She is less concerned with grand ideological concepts and more focused on escaping the suffocating constraints of Ingsoc's puritanical morality. Her acts of rebellion, such as her illicit relationship with Winston and her disdain for the Party's rigid social norms, are driven by a desire for personal pleasure and freedom of choice. Julia's rebellion is individualistic, motivated by a yearning for personal fulfillment and liberation from the Party's suffocating control over individual lives.

Orwell's contrasting portrayal of Winston and Julia's rebellious motivations highlights the limitations of both ideological and individualistic approaches to resistance. Winston's intellectual idealism, while admirable, proves ineffective in dismantling the deeply entrenched power structures of Ingsoc. His rebellion, ultimately, leads to his capture and psychological manipulation, demonstrating the futility of individual rebellion against a totalitarian regime.

Julia's individualistic approach, while providing temporary moments of personal liberation, fails to challenge the broader societal structures that perpetuate oppression. Her rebellion, ultimately, results in her betrayal of Winston, exposing the fragility of individual resistance in the face of overwhelming societal control.

Orwell's use of these contrasting characters serves as a stark warning against the dangers of authoritarianism. The suppression of individual thought, the manipulation of history, and the control of personal relationships are all hallmarks of totalitarian regimes, as exemplified by Ingsoc. Winston's intellectual rebellion, though ultimately unsuccessful, serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining critical thought and resisting societal indoctrination. Julia's individualistic rebellion, though flawed, highlights the human desire for personal freedom and the importance of challenging societal norms.

These themes remain relevant in contemporary society, where the potential for authoritarian tendencies exists within various forms of government and societal structures. The erosion of individual privacy, the manipulation of information through social media, and the suppression of dissenting voices are all potential threats to individual freedom. Orwell's cautionary tale serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance, critical thinking, and individual resistance in safeguarding personal liberty and preventing the rise of oppressive regimes.ns for a world of genuine freedom, where truth and beauty are not distorted by the Party's propaganda machine. His diary, a symbol of his defiance, serves as a sanctuary where he can express his true thoughts and feelings, free from the Party's watchful eye. Winston's rebellion is intellectual, driven by a desire to restore a sense of historical authenticity and personal integrity.

Julia, on the other hand, approaches rebellion from a more personal and instinctive standpoint. She is less concerned with grand ideological concepts and more focused on escaping the suffocating constraints of Ingsoc's puritanical morality. Her acts of rebellion, such as her illicit relationship with Winston and her disdain for the Party's rigid social norms, are driven by a desire for personal pleasure and freedom of choice. Julia's rebellion is individualistic, motivated by a yearning for personal fulfillment and liberation from the Party's suffocating control over individual lives.

Support your analysis with specific examples from the text, and consider the relevance of these themes in the context of contemporary society.",English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by AI,48,Likely Human,20.21,21.31,0,"In the novel 1984, George Orwell analyzes the behavior of man under oppression. Many consider the novel a warning against accepting authoritarianism. This closely reflects Orwells own ""political orientation,""staunchly against totalitarian regimes, both capitalist and communist. His book, published in 1949, not long after the Second World War, chronicles the experiences of a Winston Smith in a totalitarian future, set in 1984. In this vein, the book takes a close look at Smith's relationship with the ruling party, Ingsoc, and, conversely, rebellion. The novel was targeted at a western audience that bore witness to multiple authoritarian regimes, most notably, the Nazi German Reich and the Stalinist Soviet Union. Thus, to them, the events of the book were not foreign and held significant weight. The book expressly states that the chronicled dystopia could very well have become the future for its initial target audience. However, today the book is more youth-oriented and therefore has a changed message. Accordingly, modern readers can contrast their own ""futuristic""society with that of the book, most notably comparing the use of surveillance and propaganda between the two mediums. Regardless, another key tenet of the book is the relationship between Winston and his love interest Julia and their respective relationships with the government. Winston is more ideological in this relationship, while Julia cares more for the practical and personal impacts of her relationship with the government. Orwell contrasts these individual relationships with the government by illustrating each character's motivations, contrasting their behavioral patterns through the lens of actions and words.

For one, Orwell illustrates and contrasts the character's motivations. He defines Winston's motivations as ideological, describing his interest in seemingly benign acts of resistance simply based on the principle of rebellion and the promise for change. For example, when pressured to discuss why Winston had such interest in preserving worthless bits of the past, in this case, a newspaper, Winston argues, ""...it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there-small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off.""Thus, Orwell develops the allure that such small acts of such actions have for Winston. To him, the mere opportunity for societal change is worth fighting for. This is indicative of Winston's relationship with the government as well, he hates its control over thought and ""reality.""He resents the doublethink and newspeak established by the Party because it allows Ingsoc to control reality. Accordingly, his acts of rebellion are aimed at breaking the monopoly on reality that the Party has. Additionally, Orwell establishes different motivations for Julia to illustrate her relationship with the government. Orwell establishes that she is motivated by pleasure and her acts of rebellion reflect this. Since she is motivated by the pleasures of the physical world, she resents the control that the Party has over people's behavior. This can be seen in her response to Winston's ideological argument, where she counters, ""I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm interested in us.""Despite resisting Winston's high-minded concerns, Julia is still acting in rebellion with the party. Her attraction to Winston, a married man, itself is an act of rebellion, a symbol of her resentment of the behavioral norms established by the party. Although both Julia and Winston are united in three mutual disdain for the Party and the society it has established, Orwell contrasts their motivations to illustrate their individual feelings.

Likewise, Orwell also contrasts each character's behavioral patterns. For example, Winston is a man of words, both by profession and by action. When confronted by Julia over the newspaper, Winston reacts verbally, espousing the importance of such acts as means to cause change. He builds long-winded explanations in an attempt to help Julia understand the importance of his acts of rebellion, leaning on the importance of language and thought. When that seems to fail, Winston shifts to a different strategy, quick witty remarks, again relying on language, however. This affinity for language and thought is therefore embodied in his disdain for the government. When he chooses to discuss, ""the principles of Ingsoc,""he chooses, ""doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words,""all of which are methods to destroy free thought and speech. His attitude revolves around the control of ideas. This contrasts sharply with Orwell's characterization of Julia, reflecting a different, more myopic, attitude. Orwell establishes that Julia has ""not the faintest interest""for the ""ramifications of party doctrine.""Orwell describes her tendency to simply sleep through Winston's rants on such subjects. On the contrary, she is more interested in the practical ramifications of the physical world around her, concerning herself with ""when to cheer and when to boo,""claiming, ""that was all one needed.""When she is accused by Winston's that she is, ""only a rebel from the waist downwards,""she has no problem with such a statement. She finds it enamoring and chooses to take Winston into her embrace. For her, her behavior below the waist is all that matters, illustrating that one's physical confines are all that matter. Thus, her relationship with the government revolves around the physical rules she must follow.

In conclusion, Orwell contrasts Winston and Julia's respective relationships with the government by illustrating each character's motivations, contrasting their behavioral patterns via the means of expression. He establishes Winston's interest in metaphysics, discussing his interest in high-minded ideological principles, like free speech and thought. He contrasts this with Julia's more physical interests. In doing so, he explores the diversity of man under man.",
1759,1- Entirely written by me,"Examine the transformation of the institution of slavery in the Americas from 1754 to 1850.

Assess the sectional tensions that emerged as a result of these changes and their contribution to the outbreak of the Civil War. In your response, consider primary source documents that illustrate the evolving nature of slavery during this period, and analyze the broader implications of these transformations for the early American Union.",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,6,Likely Human,25.64,0.02,0,"The period between the year 1754 and the year 1850 saw a great shift in the Americas. Notably, the former colonies had formed a proper nation by the year 1850. This brought about much change, increased industry, democratic values, and greater diversity. However, no institution changed as greatly and as importantly as chattel slavery. As the portrait of America changed, so did her views on slavery, this caused great sectional tension, and eventually the Civil War. The institution of Slavery changed greatly between the years 1754 and 1850, going from a generally accepted, widespread practice to a sectionally condemned one with only one purpose: agriculture.

Firstly, the institution of slavery changed in its use. During the pre-revolutionary, colonial period, slavery was common place and touched most sectors. This can be seen in the Image from a Map of Virginia and Maryland, circa mid-1750s (Document 1), where slaves are seen working in a harbor, as instructed by white masters. Around the 1750s slavery played a big role in even city areas, like those depicted. This is in great contrast to what is seen in the Louisiana slaveholder Bennet Barrow's rules for his cotton plantation, recorded in his diary in 1838 (Document 5), where he lays out strict rules for his plantation slaves. His orders are indicative of the American slave's purpose at the time, work on a cotton plantation. Every rule recorded is designed to better facilitate Barrow's administration of the plantation. This can be contextualized by other changes in the American image. For one, greater European immigration meant an increased labor pool in urbanized areas. Likewise, the invention and widespread use of the cotton gin meant there was an increased demand for agricultural labor in the South, where a cotton mono-culture had developed. Thus, as demonstrated by the early depictions of slave's work and the shifting rules and slave codes which governed the behaviors of those in bondage, alongside greater demographic and technological shifts in the United States, it can be seen that the American slaves role shifted greatly from general labor to agrarian, specifically cotton, labor in the South.

Moreover, the institution of Slavery changed greatly in its prevalence and public opinion. During the colonial era and the early republic, few were strong critics of the institution, much less had actual legislation been put in place restricting it. Such commonality and popularity can be seen in the Advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette, published in Philadelphia, 1762 (Document 2). In the advertisement, a slave-trading organization, Willing, Morris, and Company of Philadelphia, are advertising a slave auction in Wilmington, Delaware. Such practices demonstrate that the general public on the colonial era had few grievances regarding slavery, many actively partook in it, creating a market for such businesses. However, this commonality and acceptance of slavery soon changed. A mere 26 years later, as debate of the Constitution continued, many advocated against empowering slavery. Such dissent can be seen in the essay by James Warren, in the Republican Centinel (Document 3), where he argues against counting enslaved populations toward representation in the House of Representatives in the proposed Congress. Such dissent was quite popular, in fact. It became so prevalent that those at the Constitutional Convention had to create the Three-Fifths Compromise, which dictated that slaves were to count as 3/5s of a freeman when determining representation in the House. Warrens commentary on this debate is indicative of a growing disdain over the institution, showing that slavery changed in acceptance. Furthermore, a later speech by Jeremiah Glouster, a former slave turned minister, An Oration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade (Document 4), is indicative of a further shift in public sentiment, at least in the North, toward wholesale abolition. In the speech, Gloucester argues that slavery is antithetical to American values an could not be allowed to stand. His speech, delivered in Philadelphia shows that many in Northern states felt that slavery no longer had any place in the Union. This sentiment, however, was not universal and many Southerners were in strict opposition of an restrictions on slavery. This growing shift in the standing of the institution of slavery became a flash-point in the increasingly divided union. Debates over slavery's tolerance and expansion soon need Henry Clay's series of comopromises, such as the Missouri Compromise, to temporarily placate both sides, an idea completely unneeded in the Colonial Era. Eventually, this shift in public sentiment would lead to the Civil War. Thus, it can be seen that the institution of slavery changed greatly in is acceptance and its standing in society.

In conclusion, the institution of slavery changed greatly between the years 1754 and 1850, going from a generally accepted, commonplace institution, to a deeply criticized and niche one. This shift is arguably the most important one in the Early Union, defining sectional balance and opinions while also leading the Union towards the Civil War. The shifts in the institution and their ramifications still heavily impact modern society.",

The data is stored in memory cells comprised of floating-gate transistors, each capable of holding an electrical charge to represent binary data (0s and 1s). SSDs organize these memory cells into pages, grouped into larger blocks. Reading involves the controller interpreting the electrical state of the memory cells, while writing necessitates changing the electrical state through applied voltage. Notably, SSDs do not use mechanical read/write heads or spinning disks. Wear-leveling algorithms ensure even usage of memory cells, preventing premature wear, and the controller manages data flow, handling tasks like error correction and bad block management. The TRIM command aids in maintaining performance by informing the controller of unused data blocks, allowing proactive erasure and preparation for new data. Overall, SSDs offer advantages such as faster read/write speeds, lower power consumption, and increased durability compared to traditional HDDs.",I did not provide any specific instructions.

What that identity is may vary, but everyone on this planet holds close to their identity and hopes to ensure that its integrity is preserved no matter what. In the case of many Latinx people, the land itself is a part of their identity. For Latinx people in America, who fight hard to preserve their shared identity amidst a battle between two of them, it matters more than other peoples. In her TedTalk titled ""Stopping Climate Change Starts with Heart and Latinx Communities"", Sonrisa Lucero tackles the issue of how despite a connection with the land and environment being a part of Latinx identity, Latinx people in America are pushed aside in the fight to preserve the environment.

Just like Sonrisas ancestors, countless Mexican peoples whose land was annexed by the United States were uprooted from their homes and pressured to live in neighborhoods that were predominantly other uprooted communities. There was extreme prejudice towards minorities, therefore these peoples lived in harsh conditions isolated from the white majority. This had a butterfly effect, leading to the countless Redline Neighborhoods around America. Redline neighborhoods are neighborhoods in which there is a general disadvantage to living in as a result of prejudices. Redline neighborhoods lack proper infrastructure, have little to no vegetation, lack access to proper grocery stores, and are blacklisted by many financial services and companies. A major element of a food desert that affects Latinx people is the food desert, the concept in which redlined neighborhoods can only access processed foods and generally lack access to fresh produce. People that went from living on their land for generations now are pushed aside to have no connection to the land, losing a sense of identity. All the while, the white majority implements methods of environmentalism that are not feasible for many of the Latino communities. Things like buying electric cars and recycling and using reusable bags and such are very exclusive and most often preformative. Latinx people walk, they reuse their resources, and they grow their own vegetables with the land they have, contributing to conservation efforts as they have for centuries.What Sonrisa makes the point of is that the Latinx people cannot be sidelined, or even redlined, for any longer. As a community, there must be representation on behalf of the Latinx community in government and environmentalist positions who will have a voice for the community to engage in the efforts for change. Latinx people need a reason to care as they once did, and it all starts with a voice. As representation increases and land ownership increases, the cycle that was set in motion by white oppressors many years ago will end.",

Those words her father told her remained with her as she finally experienced what he spoke of, yet as she states, this country is overwhelming. The documentary My American Girls: A Dominican Story follows the Ortiz family, a family of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who live their lives of both turmoil and celebration in the city of New York. The main family consists of mother Antonia Ortiz, father Juan ""Bautista""Ortiz, and daughters Monica,Aida, and Mayra Ortiz. Antonia and Juan work low end jobs at the hospital for long hours to support their family as well as support their extended family who moves in from the Dominican Republic. They slave away with the dream of moving back to the Dominican Republic to live their days on their land, knowing that their children are living out the American Dream they werre given from birth. Unfortunately, the life of an immigrant, although driven by dreams, is seldom a dream in reality. Monica, Aida, and Mayra all face their own struggles of belonging whether it's in school, the Dominican Republic, their own home, or even America, their experiences and circumstances put them in a position of turmoil. This concept of struggling for belonging and working for a dream is evident as a repeating theme of the story of the Ortiz family. This concept is shared by immigrants of all kinds, who have shared similar experiences to the family, whether you relate to the parents or children, the story resonates with us. This commonality helps highlight the history behind the reason why millions of people just like the Ortiz family are in the U.S. Imperialism, intervention, and destabilization is a trifecta that is simply too devastating for most countries to sustain. In the case of Dominican Americans, the mass immigration of their people was caused by the social and economic downfall of the country as a result of the CIA assassinating Rafael Trujillo in 1961. From that time onwards, people searched for an escape from crippling conditions and unsafe environments. This story has been heard so many times. From the experiences of Mexican farmers losing their livelihood to U.S foreign policies, to Puerto Rican immigrants doing anything they can to survive in the U.S, the story of the United States damaging other nations has no end.

Each of these structures exemplifies the ways in which architecture can reflect the beliefs, customs, and material advancements of its era.

The Tempietto, a small, circular temple in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, is a masterpiece of High Renaissance architecture. Constructed predominantly of stone, its design was influenced by classical Roman temples, showcasing the Renaissance era's revival of classical antiquity. The symmetry, proportion, and harmony of the Tempietto's design align with the Renaissance ideals of order and balance, reflecting a society that revered ancient Roman culture. Moreover, its location, believed to be where St. Peter was martyred, signifies the importance of Christianity in Renaissance Rome. The Tempietto stands as a testament to the era's investment in rediscovering and reinterpreting classical ideals through a Christian lens.

Bernini's Baldacchino, a large Baroque sculptural canopy, is located over the high altar of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Constructed of bronze, with gold gilding, it symbolizes the glory and majesty of the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation. The Baldacchino's twisting columns and dramatic, theatrical style are hallmarks of the Baroque era, reflecting a period where art was used as a tool for religious and political persuasion. The structure's opulence and grandeur embody the Church's power and its role as a patron of the arts during this period, seeking to inspire awe and reinforce religious devotion.

The Salon de la Princesse, a quintessential example of Rococo architecture, is located in the H√¥tel de Soubise in Paris. This salon, with its intricate plasterwork, delicate wood carvings, and mirrored panels, reflects the Rococo era's fascination with ornate, intricate design and leisurely aristocratic life. The use of light colors, curved lines, and playful, romantic themes in the decoration highlights the shift from the grandeur of Baroque to the more intimate and decorative Rococo. This salon was a space for socializing among the French nobility, indicating a society that highly valued refinement, elegance, and the arts in their private lives.

The Piazza d'Italia is an urban park in New Orleans, reflecting the Postmodern architectural style. It incorporates various materials, including stainless steel, concrete, and neon lights, to create a playful and eclectic space. This structure, with its references to classical Roman architecture interspersed with modern elements, represents the postmodernist approach of juxtaposing historical styles in a contemporary context. The Piazza d'Italia, commissioned to celebrate Italian-American culture, exemplifies postmodernism's focus on symbolism, historical reference, and the blending of high and low cultural forms. It highlights a society that is increasingly pluralistic, embracing diverse cultural heritages within a modern framework.

In conclusion, these four architectural works, each from a different stylistic period, not only showcase the material innovations of their times but also reflect the prevailing beliefs and customs. From the classical revival in Renaissance Italy to the expressive forms of the Baroque, the decorative elegance of the Rococo, and the playful historicism of Postmodernism, each building provides a window into the society that created it. Through their materials, designs, and locations, these structures reveal much about the cultural and historical contexts of their eras, demonstrating the enduring power of architecture to encapsulate and express human civilization's evolving values and ideals.","Prompt for Chat GPT4:

Question 1:

Over the course of the five hundred years we have studied this semester, representations of the human body have changed drastically. Throughout the semester, we have examined the depiction of the human body in a variety of media, such as painting, sculpture, and photography.

Please choose four examples and discuss the changing modes of showing the human body by considering qualities such as medium, realism, movement, etc. in relation to the culture/society in question. Your four examples must come from four different stylistic periods (with at least one, but not more than two, coming from the first half of the semester) and one must not be a painting. Each of the four examples must be identified by artist, title, date, medium, and cultural/historical period.",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,91,Likely Human,47.83,0.02,29.82,"The evolution of the representation of the human body in art over five centuries reveals a deep and nuanced relationship between artistic expression, medium, and the cultural and societal contexts of the time. This essay will explore this evolution through four seminal works: Michelangelo's ""David"" (1501-1504, marble, Italian Renaissance), Parmigianino's ""Madonna with the Long Neck""(1534-1540, oil on wood, Mannerism), Edouard Manet's ""Olympia""(1863, oil on canvas, Realism), and Lucian Freud's ""Naked Portrait""(1972-73, oil on canvas, Modernism).

Michelangelo's ""David"" is a triumph of Renaissance humanism, where the human body is idealized to reflect divine beauty and intellectual perfection. Crafted from marble, a medium that allows for precise and smooth contours, the sculpture depicts David as an embodiment of physical and moral virtue. The contrapposto stance, detailed musculature, and lifelike proportions reflect the Renaissance pursuit of anatomical accuracy and idealized beauty, influenced by the revival of classical antiquity. This representation of the human body is a stark contrast to the medieval depictions, which often lacked realism and were more symbolically oriented.

Moving into the Mannerist period, Parmigianino's ""Madonna with the Long Neck""showcases a deliberate departure from the proportional and compositional norms established during the Renaissance. In this oil painting, the elongated neck of the Madonna and the exaggerated forms of the figures create an ethereal, almost surreal appearance. This distortion reflects the Mannerist fascination with elegance, sophistication, and the unconventional. The shift from the realistic portrayal of the human body to a more stylized and elongated form represents a move towards the subjective interpretation of beauty and form, echoing the cultural shift towards individualism and personal expression in the Late Renaissance.

In the 19th century, Edouard Manet's ""Olympia""marked a radical shift in the depiction of the human body. Contrary to the idealized and often mythological subjects of earlier periods, Manet chose a real, contemporary subject. The painting portrays a nude woman, Olympia, gazing directly at the viewer, challenging the traditional passive female nude with a confrontational and unabashed realism. This work, with its bold brushwork and flatness, defied the academic standards of beauty and composition. It mirrored the Realist movement's focus on everyday subjects and the unvarnished truth, a reflection of the societal changes brought about by industrialization and urbanization.

Lucian Freud's ""Naked Portrait""epitomizes the Modernist exploration of the human body. Freud's use of thick impasto and a somber color palette creates a tactile, visceral quality. The unidealized, raw depiction of the human form in this work challenges the viewer's perceptions of beauty and comfort. Freud's portrayal is intensely personal and introspective, focusing on the physicality and vulnerability of the human body. This stark realism and focus on the individual subject can be seen as a response to the existential concerns of the modern era, where the human experience is examined in its most honest and often unsettling form.

In conclusion, these four works, each from a distinct stylistic period, demonstrate the dynamic and evolving representation of the human body in art. From the idealized forms of the Renaissance to the introspective realism of the Modern era, these depictions not only reflect the artistic techniques and mediums of their times but also embody the cultural, societal, and philosophical undercurrents that shaped these periods. The human body in art thus serves as a powerful lens through which to view the shifting paradigms of human thought and cultural expression over five centuries.","Prompt to Chat GPT4:

Architects aim for a sense of valuable representation within their work, as these are the monuments that are remembered and celebrated the most. Donato D'Angelo Bramante marks the site of St. Peter's crucifixion with his Tempietto, while Gian Lorenzo Bernini marks his tomb with his Baldacchino. Germain Boffrand's Salon de la Princesse is the embodiment of female influence in the 18th century and Charles Moore uses postmodernism in his work Piazza d'Italia to honor the Italian American community. Although each architect is of a different period, they all use their work to represent and symbolize what is deemed valuable.

The marker of the site of St. Peter's crucifixion lies in Donato D'Angelo Bramante's Tempietto, which was built in 1502. The Tempietto, translating to the little temple, used humanistic values and derived inspiration from ancient Rome. The structure consists of coulombs that surround its circular core. The design was inspired by older works of architecture, specifically by temples found in Rome, both of which had around structure. The dome on the Tempietto is inspired by the Rotunda of the Holy Sepulchre found in the city of Jerusalem. As in the theme of architecture in the high renaissance, there is also a use of perfect geometric forms. By using elements of older architecture, Bramante can use antiquity to bring new life to older aspects of architecture.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Baldacchino in Saint Peter's combines architecture as well as sculpture to mark Saint Peter's tomb. Made from 1624 to 1663, the Baldacchino is almost 100 feet tall and consists of four 66 foot long columns. These columns end with four angles at the top of them and watch over the corners of the canopy. The Baldacchino symbolizes the power and strength of the Catholic Church. This is depicted with the orb and cross, as they symbolize the triumph of the church, placed at the very top of the structure. As an ode to Pope Urban VIII, bees were featured in the Baldacchino. These sculptural elements and feats were all intentional and serve a symbolic meaning in the piece.

Germain Boffrand's Salon de la Princesse was constructed from 1737 to 1740. This monument was of the Rococo style and had a feminine look. This is a result of the large number of women who were in charge of the culture in the 18th century, for example, the Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great of Russia (Gardner 773). Paris was a social and cultural center and was a location where many wealthy women planned to host social gatherings in their salons. Because of this feminine style, rococo architecture featured gold embellishments and detailed moldings as found in the Salon de la Princesse.

Postmodern architects often use old styles and components and integrate them with new styles to create a collective whole. As famously presented in Charles Moore's Piazza d'Italia, built from 1976 to 1980, various different stylistic components from both traditional agriculture to popular imagery in one cohesive building. For example, the building uses stainless steel columns, a reference to medieval flying buttresses, and neon lights for nighttime viewing (Gardner 957). The way different components can be juxtaposed and complement each other is a unique aspect of postmodernism. Because the piece was dedicated to the Italian American community, Moore purposefully selected elements found in Italian history. The monument uses postmodern techniques to commemorate a community Moore wishes to acknowledge with his work.

Architecture is created with the influence of many others aside from just the architect. Many architects use different sources of inspiration that make their work unique to where, when, or for whom it was made. Donato D'Angelo Bramante's Tempietto and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Baldacchino both honored St. Peter. Women of great influence created the demand for the feminine style found in Germain Boffrand's Salon de la Princesse. By using different elements of architecture Charles Moore acknowledges the Italian American community in his Piazza d'Italia. Because these architects allow their work to be influenced by the circumstance, the values of societies are captured in time through architecture.",

Question 1:

Over the course of the five hundred years we have studied this semester, representations of the human body have changed drastically. Throughout the semester, we have examined the depiction of the human body in a variety of media, such as painting, sculpture, and photography.

Please choose four examples and discuss the changing modes of showing the human body by considering qualities such as medium, realism, movement, etc. in relation to the culture/society in question. Your four examples must come from four different stylistic periods (with at least one, but not more than two, coming from the first half of the semester) and one must not be a painting.

",History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,48,Likely Human,12.5,0.02,0,"In art beyond the 1400s, the human body has been a highly used subject for art. Traditional art often focused on biological figures as well as leaders in power. To illustrate the importance of these figures the form of their bodies was also glorified. During the High Renaissance Michelangelo's ""David"" depicts an ideal human form. This idealization grows into extremity in the period of Mannerism, where Parmigianino's ""Madonna with the Long Neck""aims to express the Madonna's elegance. However, as a contrast, the period of realism showcases reality as it is in Edouard Manet's ""Olympia"". Finally, Freud works with this idea of realism to create a sense of intentional discomfort and imperfection in the human body with his ""Naked Portrait"".

Michelangelo's ""David""was sculpted from marble in 1504 and was placed in Florence Italy. The statue's exposed body is rugged as his body and its form adds to the significance of the sculpture. David is shown with strong limbs and large hands that are detailed with veins. He is also standing off his heels and is alert. Michelangelo combines the tension found in Lysippos's work with ""the emotionalism of Hellenistic statuary""(Gardner 647). David's body is loosely idolized as he has an observable amount of muscle and an athletic physique that anticipates action. The human body is glorified to highlight its perfections even as David prepares for battle with Goliath.

Parmigianino's ""Madonna with the Long Neck"", finished in 1540, aims to amplify the beauty of the Madonna through the use of Mannerism. Many of the figures in this piece, primarily the Madonna and baby Christ on her lap, are elongated for elegance. For example, Madonna's neck is elongated and slightly curved as she looks down at her lap. Her shoulders are overly slender and the fingers that light touch her chest are also elongated. Although these features are not natural nor realistic, they do assist in emphasizing the elegance of the Madonna. These surreal features are consistent with Christ's body as his leg is an anomaly, yet intentionally, elongated as well. During the period in which Mannerism was popular, the human form in art was created with a priority of stylistic choice over realistic proportions.

Edouard Manet's ""Olympia""is an oil painting from 1863 that features a prostitute and a maid presenting her flowers. Manet uses realism to showcase the prostitute lying naked on the bed as she looks directly at the viewer. She sits with her right shoulder leaning back exposing her torso while her left-hand rests below her stomach. Her left leg crosses over her right implying she is comfortable with her client's gaze. Manet showcases the human body as it is but the subject of the body he chooses is what holds significance. Previously art consisted of many biblical figures implying art showcased only those deemed of great importance. In contrast, realism focuses on subjects that exist and can be seen in the perceivable world. Manet challenges traditional art subjects with this controversial piece that showcases a human body on an ordinary human. Some may even argue that a prostitute would be seen as less than the average person. Regardless it is apparent that Manet strikes controversy with this piece by using a taboo subject matter to illustrate that realistic art consists of what is seen in reality.

Lucian Freud's, ""Naked Portrait"", is an oil painting on canvas made in 1972. It features a naked woman lying on a bed in an uncomfortable almost fetal-like position. Her right knee is brought up to her chest by her left hand. Her left foot curls around the foot of the bed. In the age of postmodernism, this piece showcases the body almost unidolized. In traditional pieces of art, bodies were depicted in the best form possible. Freud's work contrasts that idea as he often focuses on the imperfection of the body that is often ignored in art. This allows Freud to paint a portrait of a real person that posed in a way that is opposite to traditional posing seen in art. The discomfort is felt by the viewer as well, by Freud's intentions to showcase this discomfort and imperfection of the real human body.

Various periods feature different styles of art, each exploring new limits of art than the last. While Michelangelo creates an ideal human form, Parmigianino pushes to unrealistic elongation for aesthetics. Contrastingly, Manet's use of realism allows him to use a taboo subject to show the human body more realistically, while Freud extends this ideal to imperfections in this post-modern piece of the human body shown in an awkward position. In each period, each artist uses different techniques and styles of art to depict the human body in a unique way that caters to what the artist intends to communicate with their art.",

Vincent van Gogh, a master of Post-Impressionism, has left an indelible mark on the world of art with his distinctive style and emotionally charged works. Among his oeuvre, ""Starry Night"" and ""Sunflowers"" stand out as two of his most iconic and celebrated pieces. This essay delves into these masterpieces, exploring their artistic significance, techniques, and the symbolism imbued within them.

""Starry Night"": A Window into Van Gogh's Soul

Created in 1889, during Van Gogh's time at an asylum in Saint-R√©my, France, ""Starry Night"" is more than a mere depiction of the night sky. It is a window into the soul of the artist. The painting is renowned for its vivid colors, swirling clouds, glowing stars, and a crescent moon, all coming together in a harmonious yet turbulent night scene. The use of thick, swirling brushstrokes instills a dynamic texture, infusing the painting with a pulsating energy. Van Gogh's choice of contrasting colors and bold lines accentuates the vibrancy and emotional intensity of the piece.

The symbolism in ""Starry Night"" is profound. The tumultuous sky often reflects Van Gogh's own troubled psyche. Yet, amidst this turmoil, the stars and moon exude a bright, almost hopeful light. The cypress tree, commonly associated with mourning, reaches into the sky, bridging the earthly and the eternal. This painting, beyond its aesthetic appeal, invites interpretations of Van Gogh's contemplations on life, death, and the universe.

""Sunflowers"": A Symbol of Hope and Friendship

In contrast to the nocturnal introspection of ""Starry Night,"" ""Sunflowers,"" painted in 1888, is an ode to joy and optimism. Part of a series, this version, famous for its vase of blooming sunflowers, was painted in Arles. The painting is remarkable for its use of bold, yellow hues, rendered through thick, impasto brushstrokes. In this work, color becomes a medium of emotional expression, with the vibrant yellows radiating warmth, joy, and vitality.

Sunflowers held a special significance for Van Gogh. They symbolized gratitude and were painted during a period of hope and ambition. Notably, he intended these paintings for the room of his friend and fellow artist, Paul Gauguin, signifying their friendship. The ""Sunflowers"" series, with its optimistic and bright composition, presents a stark contrast to the often-tormented nature of Van Gogh's personal life and has become synonymous with his artistic identity.

Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy of Van Gogh's Art

""Starry Night"" and ""Sunflowers"" exemplify Van Gogh's unparalleled ability to convey emotion through color, texture, and composition. While ""Starry Night"" is a portrayal of cosmic beauty intertwined with personal turmoil, ""Sunflowers"" represents the beauty of the everyday and the joy of life. These paintings, transcending time and place, continue to captivate and inspire, underscoring Van Gogh's profound impact on the art world. His works are not mere paintings; they are emotional experiences, inviting viewers to glimpse into the depths of the artist's soul and the wonders of the world as he saw it.",I just put in the prompt

This phenomenon is particularly interesting because it contradicts standard economic theory, which assumes that a person's willingness to pay for a good is equal to their willingness to accept compensation to give it up.

I experienced the EVT personally in a situation involving a pair of old running shoes. These shoes were worn out, with fading colors and fraying at the seams. Objectively, they were probably worth very little, and I had newer, better pairs available. However, when a friend casually suggested that I should throw them out, I was surprised by my own reaction. I felt a strong reluctance to part with them.

This reaction was puzzling at first, as I hadn't used those shoes in months. But then I realized that these shoes held a special value to me. They were the first pair I bought when I started running, a hobby that had become an essential part of my life. I had worn them during my first 5K race, and they were a tangible reminder of my journey from a novice to a regular runner. These experiences had endowed the shoes with a personal value far beyond their physical worth or utility.",no I just put in the prompt

What their personality is like, what their hobbies are, and especially how they act and behave. For instance if a person was told to think about their mother, a lot of people would think about traits and characteristics of their mom. On top of that they will also think of their mother's actions and behavior. They might think about a time when they were being lectured by her, how she talks super loud on the phone, or maybe even how she would make dinner and call the family to the table every night. To that person all of these are things normal activity or ""in the scope""of things that their mother would do. Now imagine that same mother one day just randomly flipped the table over at dinner, this is outside the scope of what is normal for their mother. This would be an example of Expectancy Violation. She violated the ""social norm""that has been established. How would the son/daughter react to this scenario? Expectancy Violation Theory, otherwise known as EVT, analyzes and deciphers how individuals respond to unexpected behavior or behavior that violates ""norms""of society or anticipated events. These norms are established from prior interactions, and previous experiences with the violator. When this violation occurs, it creates a state of arousal that creates a wide variety of emotions and behaviors.



A study was done in 2014 to determine if there was any link between being unfriended on facebook and Expectancy Violation Theory. The purpose of this study was to see why people were getting unfriended and if EVT had any role in the reason or the result of getting unfriended. The method they used was to give five hundred and forty seven adults (eighteen years or older) that know they have been unfriended by at least one person. The questionnaire asked them measures such as were you expecting this person to unfriend you, was it a minor or major impact that they did unfriend you, and was there a positive or negative effect (Bevan, 2014). It was determined that a person being unfriended does experience expectancy violation. The study showed this is more apparent in females than males. It also showed that the female participants anticipated their ex facebook friends to be less ""close""or more distant with their friendship in the real world. Interestingly enough the study showed that the more facebook friends the user had, they were less likely to experience expectancy violation after getting unfriended. The study also showed that people not only felt EVT when getting unfriended, but also that a person may unfriend someone because they had experienced EVT from their posts or profile (Bevan, 2014). For instance a friend of yours may post about a controversial topic, with the opposite opinion as you. If you react to that and choose to unfriend them because of it, you have just experienced EVT. They violated the norms of what you expected from them. So overall this study proved that Expectancy Violation Theory is not only experienced when getting unfriended, but also the reason users unfriend others.",

The title basically describes the piece. This painting depicts a human skeleton that appears to be smoking a cigarette. One of my favorite things about this work is the color. I really enjoyed how van Gogh used the darker themes and colors for this work. It gives the painting a much more dreary and ghastly atmosphere. Also the way van Gogh introduces lighting and where it is ""pointing""at in this painting, adds to the unsettling aura. This painting can be interpreted in many ways. It seems that van Gogh was focusing on the topic of ""death"". The dark themes, the bones and no flesh, the cigarette, he was conveying a grim feeling to his viewers. The work itself is very detailed. The medium for this painting was oil paint. If you zoom in and look at this piece at a much closer angle, you will be able to see all the strokes, marks and impressions left from his brush, finger, and whatever else he used to make this piece. On top of that, the strokes themselves add texture to the artwork, you are able to see where he used more paint and where he used less. Specifically the top left of the painting on the skull, you can see he used a glob of white/off white paint to emphasize the light in that area. If you ran your hand across the painting you would feel the indents and the ridges left by these different techniques. He not only added physical texture but also visual/non physical texture to this work. The small cracks and ridges of the bones make it seem that this skeleton is not the smoothest body. As well as the teeth they show a sharp and almost ""Painful""view. The skeleton is crushing the cigarette as it does not have lips, it has to bite down on the cigarette, which is very unusual to do. This illustration shows a very rigid texture for this skeleton's teeth. Overall van Gogh made an amazing piece with his use of techniques and skill. I believe that his goal when working on this, was to create a chilling piece that would grab the viewer's attention, and he truly achieved that.





Vincent Van Gogh, created an oil-paint based self-portrait in the late 1880s while living in Paris entitled ""Self Portrait with Grey Felt Hat"". His stay in Paris influenced his style of art as he studied the pointillist technique, a form of painting or drawing style where an artist applies small, separate dots of color to create an image. However, Van Gogh used his own variation by running brushstrokes in different directions, instead of a systematic, single, and unified method of paint application. This painting is one of Vincent Van Gogh's boldest color experiments, placing complimentary colors alongside another, creating an intense illusion of color blended together in the painting. The portrait employs diverse textures throughout the canvas that show graphic brushstrokes to be directional, allowing the shapes and planes to convey structure and volume around his head and a growth pattern of his facial hair. He used blue and orange colors in the background of the portrait, and red and green colors in his beard. This approach helps enhance color contrast with the brushstrokes creating a halo-like circle around his head. This variation and the dynamics shown have initiated Vincent Van Gogh's contribution to this new style of painting. Overall, the energetic brushstrokes, vibrant palette of colors, and free-flowing modes of art have expressed dynamic evocations of a signature style to exemplify Post-Impressionism and influenced German-Expressionism to develop modern art.

Introduction:

In the grand tapestry of life, challenges often serve as the crucible in which our character is forged, our resilience tested, and our understanding of self deepened. While challenges come in myriad forms, my personal journey has been uniquely shaped by the paradoxical obstacle of being perceived as too perfect. This seemingly enviable trait became a silent adversary, pushing me to confront the expectations and assumptions associated with perfection and ultimately teaching me the invaluable lessons of authenticity and vulnerability.

Body:

The first inkling of this challenge emerged during my academic years when consistently high grades and commendable achievements became synonymous with my identity. While outwardly celebrated, the pressure to maintain an illusion of perfection took a toll on my mental well-being. The fear of failure, of tarnishing the meticulously crafted facade, became a constant companion. As setbacks inevitably crept in, the chasm between reality and perception widened, and I found myself standing at the crossroads of a pivotal choice.

The turning point came during a challenging semester when the demands of coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal expectations converged into a perfect storm. Despite my best efforts, a notable academic setback unfolded, shattering the illusion of infallibility. The experience was humbling, exposing the fragility of perfection and forcing me to confront the vulnerability I had long sought to conceal.

In the aftermath of this setback, I grappled with feelings of disappointment and self-doubt. However, in the crucible of adversity, I discovered a reservoir of resilience and an opportunity for profound personal growth. I began to dismantle the facade of perfection, recognizing that true strength lay not in an unblemished record but in the authenticity of one's journey.

The journey toward embracing imperfection was not without its challenges. Breaking free from the shackles of perfectionism required a reevaluation of my self-worth and an acceptance of the inherent beauty in vulnerability. I sought support from mentors, friends, and mental health resources to navigate this transformative process. Through introspection and self-compassion, I unearthed the realization that perfection is a mirage-a transient and unattainable ideal that obscures the rich tapestry of human experience.

The experience prompted a profound shift in my mindset. I began to view setbacks not as indicators of personal failure but as opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Each stumble became a stepping stone, propelling me forward on a journey toward a more authentic and fulfilling version of myself.

In the crucible of imperfection, I cultivated resilience, adaptability, and a newfound appreciation for the nuances of life. The pressure to meet external expectations gave way to a profound sense of liberation. As I embraced vulnerability, I discovered the power of connection-the ability to relate to others on a more profound level, unburdened by the constraints of a flawless facade.

Conclusion:

The challenge of being perceived as too perfect served as a catalytic force, propelling me toward a more authentic and fulfilling existence. Through setbacks and moments of vulnerability, I unearthed a reservoir of strength that transcended the confines of perfection. The lessons learned during this journey have become the bedrock of my personal and professional pursuits, shaping a narrative that celebrates the beauty of imperfection.

As we navigate the intricate terrain of our lives, let us recognize that the path to success is often paved with the stones of setbacks and challenges. In embracing imperfection, we not only liberate ourselves from the shackles of unrealistic expectations but also open the door to a richer, more meaningful human experience-one that celebrates the beauty found in the flaws and complexities of our shared journey.","The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success.

Introduction:

Sports betting, often considered a form of entertainment, has evolved into a global phenomenon with a significant impact on various aspects of society. While critics often focus on the potential drawbacks, it is essential to acknowledge the multifaceted benefits that sports betting can offer. This essay aims to explore the positive dimensions of sports betting, shedding light on its societal, economic, and individual advantages.

1. Economic Stimulus:

One of the primary benefits of sports betting lies in its capacity to stimulate economic growth. The industry generates substantial revenue through various channels, including betting platforms, bookmakers, and associated businesses. Taxes imposed on these entities contribute significantly to government coffers, funding public services and infrastructure development. The economic ripple effect extends to employment opportunities, creating jobs in sectors such as technology, marketing, and customer service. As a result, the sports betting industry becomes an integral part of a thriving economy.

2. Entertainment and Social Cohesion:

Beyond its economic impact, sports betting serves as a potent source of entertainment and social cohesion. The shared experience of wagering on sports events fosters a sense of community among enthusiasts. Whether through friendly wagers among friends or participation in organized betting communities, individuals find a common ground that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. This communal aspect contributes to the fabric of social interaction, providing a shared passion that brings people together.

3. Technological Advancements:

The evolution of sports betting has paralleled advancements in technology, resulting in innovative platforms and applications. The integration of artificial intelligence, data analytics, and virtual reality enhances the overall user experience, making sports betting more engaging and accessible. This technological convergence not only attracts a diverse demographic but also stimulates progress in related fields, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.

4. Skill Development and Analytical Thinking:

Contrary to the perception of sports betting as a purely luck-based endeavor, it requires a considerable degree of skill and analytical thinking. Successful bettors often engage in extensive research, analyzing statistics, player performance, and historical data. This analytical approach hones critical thinking skills, mathematical acumen, and strategic decision-making- attributes that extend beyond the realm of sports betting. The cultivation of these skills can have a positive spill-over effect into other areas of life, contributing to personal and professional development.

5. Financial Literacy and Responsibility:

Engaging in sports betting necessitates a level of financial literacy and responsibility. Bettors learn to manage their resources, set budgets, and make informed decisions based on risk and reward. This practical experience with financial concepts can translate into improved financial literacy, benefitting individuals in their broader financial endeavors. Moreover, the awareness of responsible gambling practices instilled within the sports betting community contributes to a culture of mindful wagering, mitigating the risks associated with excessive gambling.

6. Sponsorship and Investment Opportunities:

The symbiotic relationship between sports and betting is exemplified through sponsorship and investment opportunities. Sports betting companies often engage in partnerships with sports leagues and teams, injecting significant financial support into the sports industry. These collaborations result in enhanced sporting events, improved facilities, and increased visibility for athletes. The infusion of capital into sports, facilitated by the sports betting industry, creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem that elevates the overall quality and appeal of sports globally.

7. Psychological and Emotional Well-being:

While sports betting is often scrutinized for its potential negative impact on mental health, it is crucial to recognize its positive contributions to psychological and emotional well-being. The excitement and anticipation associated with wagering on sports events can provide a healthy outlet for stress relief. Moreover, successful bets can boost confidence and self-esteem, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances an individual's overall mental resilience.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, sports betting, often viewed through a critical lens, presents a multifaceted tapestry of benefits that extend beyond mere financial gain. Its contributions to economic growth, social cohesion, technological innovation, skill development, financial literacy, sponsorship opportunities, and psychological well-being collectively underscore its relevance in contemporary society. While acknowledging the importance of responsible gambling practices, it is imperative to appreciate the positive dimensions of sports betting, recognizing its potential to enrich lives and contribute to the vibrancy of the global sports and entertainment landscape.

Dangal was a sports/biographical movie that was made in 2016 by Nitesh Tiwari. The film stars include Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh, etc. Dangal is a movie that is two hours and forty one minutes long. The premise of the movie is that Mahavir Singh Phogat initially wants a son to accomplish his dream of winning gold for India in wrestling because his family held him back from doing it himself, even though he was extremely talented. He kept getting daughters, which made him give up on his dreams. However, one day, when his older two daughters, Geeta and Babita, were teens, they beat up other teenage boys, and the father realized that he could raise them to be wrestlers. Because of the time period and the place, they all faced societal and cultural pressures to stop the girls from wrestling, but he persisted and raised them into becoming great wrestlers; they went from amateur level wrestlers, to state level, and finally national level champions. Eventually, both daughters get on India's national wrestling team, and win gold in the Commonwealth games. This movie sheds light upon many important issues such as feminism, cultural stereotypes, and the patriarchy. After watching it, one can say that Dangal fights against sexist and misogynistic values, and supports empowerment for women.

The scene that clearly depicts this statement is when the oldest daughter, Babita, goes to fight in her first amateur wrestling competition. The first thing we see is that it is a local village carnival/festival, and only men are present, which depicts the stereotype and cultural norm that only the men go out and have fun, while the women are at home. When the father tells the organizers that he wants his daughter to participate in the tournament, the group of other men laugh at him and his daughters in a very derogatory way. They were clearly being sexist and misogynistic because they never have seen nor do they want a girl to wrestle, so they try to shoo her off. The organizer then says ""sir, the day I organize a cooking competition, that day get Ms.Geeta along,""this then comes back to a very overused, harsh misogynistic stereotype that women should only be cooking and taking care of the household. This goes hand in hand with the fact that parts of India are very sexist along with the fact that the sport of wrestling does not have that much exposure to women there. In India women are seen as less than, lower than men due to societal norms that have been in place for many years. Men in India have a superiority complex, in turn, helps them express their embedded misogyny to women in many ways. These ways are expressed in Dangal through the way the father and his daughter were treated by the other men at the tournament. The father had these misogynistic ways embedded in him until he had daughters, and he saw their potential. Mahavir gets past the fact that many men will talk down and see him in a lower manner, he begins to speak up for his daughters. Mahavir then gets mad and says ""either Geeta fights‚Ä¶ or you and I"", in support of his daughter, which gets the organizer scared and in retaliation he says that he is an honorable person unlike the father, and he would never let a girl wrestle. The word ""honorable""in this case stems from cultural norms and expectations. In these parts of India, honor and pride mean a lot to people, so anything that goes against it can cause many problems, even to the extremes of honor killings.

As the father and daughters are being sent away, the organizers realize that having a girl wrestle for the first time will bring in a lot of attraction and money, so they reluctantly allow her to fight. This is also somewhat sexual objection because they see her as a marketing tool to make more money, instead of as a skilled wrestler that can provide good competition. As preparations for the match were getting started, men were piling around the ring with very dirty looks and smiles on their faces. Some of them even let out comments like ""I hope she also wears the short shorts"", ""she looks hot"", or ""I hope her shirt doesn't tear"". These men are blatantly objectifying and sexualizing a young girl, which has been a common practice in India, Geeta is asked to choose her opponent from a group of four young men ranging from small and thin to bigger and muscular, and the crowd is extremely surprised when she chooses the bigger guy because she is there to prove a point and show her talent. Even the referee tries to tell the other guy to go easy on Geeta and not break her bones, proving that everyone just looks down upon her just because she is a girl. Up until this point of the movie the sexism, misogyny, objectification, and cultural stereotypes were very prevalent, but after this fight people realize what she is capable of and they slowly stop and respect her more.

Throughout the fight, Geeta and her opponent are equal, fighting head to head. The crowd is cheering in support because they see that she can actually fight even though the competitor was physically a lot bigger than her. Although she loses at the very end, the crowd cheers for her and the sponsors even give her a larger cash prize than they give to the actual winner. From here we see Geeta and Babita going to various different local wrestling competitions, fighting, winning, and garnering more attention. As this happens they are also getting more respect and the same people that would insult them and their family started to compliment them and pay their respects, especially the men. This turns over the generalized misogyny and sexism in India for a moment. These two women helped pave the way for women to be able to get into the sports industry in India. Geeta and Babita showed that even though they hail from an extremely patriarchal village, they were able to prove everyone wrong and be successful in taking part in a sport that is primarily dominated by men.

Drug Possession Should Be Decriminalized

When the war on drugs began in the early 1970s, the number of incarcerations due to possession has risen significantly present day. Many of the people serving time are people of color, who typically face longer sentences than their white counterparts. Instead of arresting people, drug possession should be decriminalized. It would benefit public health and safety, since millions of people are arrested due to drug charges, yet that has done nothing to reduce drug availability or provide help to those who need it. If drug possession was decriminalized, the country could implement rehabilitation programs as well as medical and mental assistance to those suffering, all while reducing the number of people charged with possession.

When looking at drug-related charges as a whole, it is evident that people of color face the most repercussions when arrested for drug-related offenses. According to a study conducted by Yale School of Public Health, when assessing black and white non-violent drug offenders in New Haven, blacks were more likely to have sales and possessions charges, mainly for marijuana, a less addictive drug, while their white counterparts were 5-7 times less likely to be incarcerated for the same offense (National Library of Medicine). This institutional racism stems from the war on drugs, during which copious amounts of drugs were peddled into mostly low-income neighborhoods with a high black population. In 1917,

when President Nixon started the war on drugs, federal anti-drug spending increased by 200 million by the end of his presidency, with most of this money allocated to incarcerate people of color. Due to this, even during present times, black people were more frequently charged with possession and drug sales. While the Yale study clearly states that the white people who participated had 30 percent more incarcerations than the black people, their sentences were significantly lower, even for more addicting drugs. 49 percent of the black people's drug of choice was marijuana and only 7 percent said their preferred drug was heroin, meanwhile, 10 percent of the white people stated their drug of choice was marijuana and 50 percent said it was heroin. Those who preferred addictive and lethal drugs were given a far less sentence for a drug whose effect was not as bad. This is mainly because of demographics; those who live in poverty filled neighborhoods are more likely to be arrested for possession and intent to sell, which is why mass incarcerations occur in these neighborhoods. Out of all the inmates in federal prison, the highest percentage of people are incarcerated for drug-related offenses, at 46.3 percent, compared to the next highest category which is charges related to weapons, arson, and explosives, which is significantly lower at 20.3 percent. By decriminalizing said substances, the number of mass incarcerations and institutional racism can be much lower, since people will not be arrested for drug-related offenses.

In New York City, 1 in 3 people arrested for possession are repeat offenders (Human



Rights Watch). Out of all those people, 63 percent were convicted of the lowest level

offenses, felony classes C-E. With all of these incarcerations, most of those who have been arrested have not stopped using or selling, since many of those in prison are repeat offenders. Our current policies are diverting law enforcement resources from more serious public safety issues. Our limited public resources would be better spent on expanding access to effective drug treatment and other health services rather than funding our prisons. In Portugal, drugs have been decriminalized since 2001. Since then, Portugal's drug situation has improved remarkably. The idea to decriminalize drugs was first introduced as a way to battle the HIV/AIDS epidemic that was taking the world by storm. While being a sexually transmitted virus, it was also spread quickly by people sharing needles, as 1 in 10 people contracted HIV through various drug-related devices. Therefore, Portugal's choice to decriminalize drugs was due to health-related reasons first; the country's health-centered approach to drugs, as well as wider health and social policy changes, are equally, if not more, responsible for the positive changes observed. At first, people assumed that decriminalizing drugs in Portugal would lead to more overdoses and drug-related deaths since people would face no repercussions for possession. This, however, did not happen. Instead of arresting those who were in possession of these illegal drugs, Portugal used the resources and funds that were allocated to prisons to create a variety of anti-use programs. These were utilized to help prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and social integration. Since then, the HIV infection

rate fell from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million to 4.2 cases per million in 2015, levels of drug use have declined significantly, and deaths due to drug use has fallen from approximately 80 in 2001 to 16 in 2012 (Transform Drugs). If the United States

implemented this same idea, then the health of many Americans charged with possession would flourish.

People think that by decriminalizing possession, law enforcement is essentially letting those caught with possession scot-free. This, however, is not the case. People often confuse the terms ""decriminalize""and ""legalize""and treat them as if they were interchangeable. Legalization is the process of removing prohibitions against controlled substances. Decriminalizing drugs would still make them illegal, but the legal system would not prosecute a person for possession under a specified amount. Instead, a variety of measures can be implemented. Recently, Oregon has become the first state in the country to decriminalize the possession of drugs. Instead of arresting someone who was found in possession of controlled substances, they are either asked to pay a 100 dollar fine or participate in a health assessment. Based on that, the person can either choose to go to therapy and other programs to become clean. Not only does this help reduce the number of drug users, but it also removes the stigma around seeking help. Most addicts cannot admit that they need help, let alone go actively seeking it. People are also ashamed of asking for help since they do not want to be labeled as a ""drug addict"". With this system implemented,

many users can take the first step to getting clean, which will stop them from becoming repeat offenders. By decriminalizing drugs, those who suffer from addiction will be required to attend programs and meetings to reduce the chances of them using drugs again.

Overall, the need to decriminalize drugs is more important now than ever before. The number of mass incarcerations is higher than they've ever been, with billions of dollars allocated to our prison system rather than for the betterment of those incarcerated. With blatantly racist roots, the war on drugs has impacted our country's way of life. By focusing on punishing those who were charged with possession, we have done nothing to reduce the number of drug-related offenses. By decriminalizing the possession of drugs, we would be getting justice for those who have spent countless years in prison solely because of possession and bettering the lives of those battling an addiction to controlled substances, all while reducing the number of drug-related offenses, deaths, and illnesses.

Vittorio De Sica's movie Bicycle Thieves portrays the harsh realities of life post World War II. The opening scene shows an unpaved road and a city which is built in the middle of nowhere.After the war, there were no subsidies to finish the roads or build up public works. The main character Antonio Ricci has not had a job for two years, and one day he is finally offered a job hanging up posters. However, he needs to have a bike for this job and does not currently have one. Through some quick thinking from his wife, he ends up obtaining a bicycle. But because of the despondency of the entirety of the lower class, someone steals Antonio's bike. This film chronicles the struggles that Antonio goes through as a result of his bike being stolen. The film shows the desperation that was rampant during the time. Unemployment was widespread and there was a lack of solidarity among the poor. Everyone had to fend for themselves, and there was no sense of community because all the impoverished people were fighting over jobs. It was very common for people from lower classes to steal stuff because that was their only option.

De Sica's film was a major contribution to the neorealist movement. Neorealism started in Italy during the end of World War II as a pressing response to the political turmoil and desperate economic conditions afflicting the country (""Italian Neorealism""). The war was a majorly catastrophic event for Italy that completely transformed their way of life. Before the war, Italy was one of the most fruitful and prominent filmmaking countries. They specialized in creating grand films with large budgets, enormous sets, and thousands of actors (""Italian Neorealism""). However, during the war, Italy was occupied by the Germans and then the Americans, and the landscape was war torn. After the war, the studios were no longer usable, all the major actors had left the country, and there was not much money for film equipment (""Italian Neorealism""). Italian directors such as De Sica wanted to portray simple stories about the struggles of everyday people. This movement later on became known as Neo-realism.

One of the most well-known examples of neorealism is Bicycle Thieves since the movie is dedicated to revealing the daily issues of life post World War II. Bicycle Thieves is considered the epitome of neorealism because there is not much dramatic action and the events are scattered and not connected in any particular way (Shiel 55). It really strives to portray the daily lives of ordinary people. From the location of the film, the viewer can see that everything is in shambles. The buildings look dilapidated and are crumbling, and the terrain is rough and unfinished. The viewer is introduced to the main character, Antonio Ricci, with a forlorn look on his face, looking like he has given up. Throughout the movie, there are constant insights into how the residents of the city were living in lackluster conditions. One criticism of neorealistic films is that they only describe poverty (Zavattini 67). However, Zavattini argues that poverty must be addressed because it was one of the most pressing issues of the time, and is a topic that could be explored for an entire lifetime. Neorealistic films are important because they give the viewer a glimpse into what life was like during the time period in a very raw and realistic way. Unlike American films during the time, Zavattini believed the neorealistic Italian films were pure and were a very accurate representation of the occurrences that happened day by day. On the other hand, Tomasulo argues that the film shows the viewers specific socially determined representations of postwar Italy such as housing conditions, unemployment, and alienation, but they are separated from reality (2). The scenes that occur in the movie are representations of real conditions, but they become distorted (Tomasulo 2-3). From this viewpoint, it is true that the subject of the movie is constructed and may not be completely true to life because of the biases of the directors and actors.

Social class is a major theme in this film. The conflict between social classes is particularly evident when Antonio takes Bruno out to eat at a fancy restaurant. From the minute Antonio and Bruno step in, it is obvious that they are out of place. They sit beside a wealthy family, and the differences between the two groups is very apparent. Bruno tries to use the silverware that is handed to him but is unable to. This shows how Bruno's cultural capital is disparate from that of the wealthy young boy. Since Bruno was raised in a low income family, he never learned the dining etiquette required in fancier restaurants. Furthermore, the wealthy child keeps turning around and giving Bruno snobby glances. The idea that even children were prejudiced against the lower classes says a lot about society and how divided it was. Since the majority of the movie is focused on poor, working class people, this scene stands out as a contrast to how lower class individuals lived their lives. Nevertheless, there were still stratifications within a class. Even though Antonio is looked down upon by middle to upper class people at the restaurant, he shares commonalities with the privileged class in some ways. For example, while on the job, he ignores the beggars on the street (Tomasulo 8). This demonstrates the mentality that every man is out to fend for himself.

Moreover, disinterest in religion is a striking theme in this film. After the war, people lost faith in humanity and strayed away from religion. De Sica portrays religion in a negative light in this film, showing the uselessness of tradition and the deceitfulness of some church goers. Something very evident in the church scene of Bicycle Thieves is the focus on tradition and respectability. When Antonio enters the church with his son Bruno, the viewer sees men being shaved in order to be decent for church. These people are also dressed nicely and follow rigid guidelines on how to present themselves during the service. Everyone is quiet, well behaved, and follow along with the prayers when they are supposed to. Antonio provides a disparity to this image of order. Because Antonio is so frantic in finding his bicycle, his desire to communicate with a man who might have information to his bicycle makes him very conspicuous. He speaks too loudly and walks through the praying crowds with little regard for their customs. Another example of Antonio's distinction from the rest of the crowd which is very silent and reverent occurs when two men tell him that he needs to leave. Antonio completely ignores their comments and the proceedings at church. His actions reflect the post-war view that church traditions were irrelevant and superficial. This was because people were more concerned about the current state of their lives rather than spiritual proceedings.

Another important aspect of the movie is the relationship between Antonio and the people around him, namely his family. Towards the beginning of the movie, we can see that there is a strong bond between him and his son, Bruno. Bruno looks up to his father. In one scene, during which Antonio is getting ready for his first day on the job, we can see that Bruno dresses like his father and is given the same egg sandwich to eat. Furthermore, his actions mimic his father in the way that he puts the sandwich into his front pocket of his overalls. This shows how Bruno looks up to his father a lot and wants to be like him. There is a strong bond between the two. The ambiance is lighthearted and happy, and there is a skip in Antonio's step. But soon into his first day, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio tries to chase the thief, but the thief gets away, and Antonio is left standing on the streets with a look of disappointment. Since he no longer has a bike, he can not do his job effectively and his joyfulness is crushed. From here, the story takes a downward turn, and the feeling of desperation returns. During some parts of the movie, the father becomes too preoccupied about getting the bike back, and it becomes more about his pride than providing for his son. At one point, they become a bit distant, and Bruno starts to show his own personality. Bruno still idolizes his dad, but as the movie continues and the search drags on, he sees his dad in a different way. Usually parents put on a brave face for their children, so humiliation and discouragement are not emotions that a young child would expect to see in his father. This is especially true because men were considered the head of the family. With his own son, Antonio shows the strictness and authoritarian idea of the patriarchy (Tomasulo). As Reich said, ""in the figure of the father the authoritarian state has its representative in every family, so that the family becomes its most important instrument of power...The structural reproduction of a society's economic system in the psychology of the masses is the basic mechanism in the process of the formation of political ideas"" (qtd. In Tomasulo). Antonio feels pressure to provide for his family and to be the breadwinner of the household. He clearly cares about his family, but on some deeper level, he probably feels as though his masculinity is being threatened when he is unable to find his bike. He finally felt like he had some control, and the thief stripped away his power and masculinity when he stole Antonio's bike. The relationship between father and son is crucial in the message of this movie because it shows the breakdown of familial relationships in a melancholy post war society.

In addition, there are gender conflicts between Antonio and his wife, Maria. The viewer can assume that there has been previous tension and frustration between the two because Antonio has been unemployed for two years. This was especially difficult because the man was the only one who could provide for the family. During their interactions throughout the course of the film, their body language is really stiff. Their dynamic is interesting because the woman is more strong-willed and thrifty one in the relationship. When Antonio tells her about the job, he starts off by saying ""Do I have rotten luck or what"" (The Bicycle Thieves). He then continues to complain about his situation and how unfortunate it is, while his wife continues to prod him to get him to tell her what exactly he means. While Antonio curses the day he was born and says he wants to jump into the river, Maria is thinking of a plan rather than being rash. She is the one who comes up with the idea of pawning their sheets in exchange for the bike. In Italy, the idea of a stable, productive nuclear family has always been important (Shiel 57). Family plays a large role in Italian culture, and the fact that this film showed the disintegration of such an important relationship adds to its neorealistic qualities.

The ending note of Bicycle Thieves is depressing, yet fitting. Antonio is unable to find his bike. Looking defeated, he and his son trudge off along with other people in the crowd. It is very open-ended and leaves the viewer wondering what will happen to Antonio and his family. The closing scene really solidifies the themes of anguish and despair during the post war years, and provides a heartbreaking yet realistic view of the difficulties that many Italians faced. The movie ends with Antonio and Bruno disappearing into the crowd of people. The meld together with the congregation of people, showing how although their story is bitter and distressing, it is not unique.",
6169,4- AI-generated,"2) In Homer, Herodotus, Athenian tragedy, and Athenian Old Comedy, we see the consequences of war considered in various ways. Did the Greeks glorify war? Did they abhor it? Or is the picture complicated by historical and literary context?",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,84,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,58.33,14.76,45.99,"

The Greeks' perspective on war, as depicted in their literature, reveals a complex and multifaceted attitude that cannot be reduced to simple glorification or abhorrence. In Homeric epics like the ""Iliad,"" war is a backdrop for heroic deeds and personal glory, yet it also uncovers the deep sorrows and tragedies of human conflict.

Herodotus, in his historical accounts, presents war as both a grand stage for human ambition and a source of untold suffering, highlighting the highs and lows of human endeavor. Athenian tragedies often delve into the darker aspects of war, exposing the pain, loss, and ethical dilemmas it brings. Euripides, for example, frequently portrays the devastating impact of war on women and families, offering a poignant counterpoint to the glorification of battle.

In Old Comedy, playwrights like Aristophanes use satire to critique war, revealing its absurdities and the folly of those who pursue it without regard for its consequences. This genre often reflects public sentiment, suggesting a populace weary of conflict, particularly in light of the prolonged Peloponnesian War.



Continuing from the previous discussion, the Greeks' literary tradition reveals an evolving understanding of war's impact on society. While the ""Iliad"" and other Homeric tales glorify the heroism and honor in battle, they do not shy away from depicting the grief and devastation that war brings. The death of Hector and the subsequent grief of his family serve as a powerful reminder of the human cost of war.

Athenian tragedies, particularly those of Euripides, often portray war's brutality and its ruinous effects on the human spirit. In plays like ""The Trojan Women,"" the focus shifts from the glory of warriors to the suffering of the victims, primarily women and children, who bear the brunt of war's aftermath. This shift in perspective is a stark reminder that war, beyond its heroic facade, brings profound suffering and loss.

These nuanced portrayals in Greek literature suggest that the Greeks' attitude towards war was not monolithic but deeply conflicted. Their works reflect a society that both celebrates the heroic ideals of battle and mourns the inevitable tragedies that war entails. This duality in their literature underscores the complex nature of war, serving as a timeless reminder of its dual capacity for both nobility and destruction.



Hence, the Greek view of war, as shown through their literature, is nuanced and influenced by the historical and societal context. It oscillates between admiration for heroism and a deep awareness of war's inherent tragedies.",WRite like my essay from above
2324,4- AI-generated,"Think of figures like Thersites and Dolon in the Iliad, Tellus in Herodotus, Hecuba in Euripides and Dicaeopolis in Aristophanes. Answer this: do you think the Greeks developed new and different ideas of noble character and action in the late 5th c. in contrast to Homeric models?",Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,n/a or prefer not to say,Likely Written by AI,98,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,52.5,0.08,16.12,"

The Greek conception of noble character and action underwent significant evolution from the Homeric era to the late 5th century, as evidenced by literary characters from different periods. In Homer's ""Iliad,"" characters like Achilles and Hector exemplify traditional heroism, characterized by martial prowess, honor, and loyalty to one's comrades and city-state.

By the late 5th century, however, playwrights like Euripides and Aristophanes introduced characters like Hecuba and Dicaeopolis, who embodied more complex, nuanced traits. These characters often questioned traditional values, revealing the human costs of war and challenging the notion of heroism as purely physical bravery. In Herodotus's histories, figures like Tellus exemplify a shift toward valuing personal happiness and the well-being of the polis over individual glory in battle.

This shift reflects broader changes in Greek society and thought, including the rise of democracy in Athens and philosophical inquiries into the nature of justice and the good life. The late 5th century saw an increased emphasis on intellectual and moral virtues, a growing skepticism of traditional heroic ideals, and a deeper exploration of individual psychology and moral ambiguity.

The transformation of Greek literature from the Homeric era to the late 5th century reflects a profound shift in the Greek psyche and societal norms. Characters like Thersites and Dolon in the ""Iliad"" represent the early seeds of this transformation. These figures, though minor, begin to question the traditional heroic ideal. Thersites, with his sharp tongue, criticizes the leaders and the war itself, embodying a skepticism that would become more pronounced in later Greek literature. Dolon's attempt at espionage, fueled by a promise of material reward rather than glory, contrasts sharply with the honor-driven motives of Homeric heroes.

In the works of Euripides, characters like Hecuba portray the immense human suffering caused by war, a theme that diverges from the Homeric glorification of battle. Euripides' plays often center on the experiences and sufferings of women, a perspective largely absent in earlier Greek epics. This shift in focus from the battlefield to the home, from warriors to civilians, marks a significant departure in the portrayal of noble character. Similarly, Aristophanes, through characters like Dicaeopolis in ""The Acharnians,"" uses satire to critique war and the societal status quo. Dicaeopolis' individualistic pursuit of peace at any cost, even at the risk of being labeled a traitor, highlights a growing disenchantment with traditional values of heroism.

These literary evolutions mirror the complex sociopolitical changes in Greece during this period, especially in Athens. The rise of democracy, the devastating Peloponnesian War, and the philosophical inquiries of Socrates and his contemporaries all contributed to a more introspective and critical view of traditional heroic ideals. Thus, by the late 5th century, Greek literature reflects a society grappling with new ideas about morality, individuality, and the true meaning of noble character and action.",Okay write an essay in the same style as the one before and answer the question: ( I put in my actual essay that I wrote entirely by me)

Achilles, a man favored by the gods, destined to live a short life on the battlefield, but a long and peaceful one should he leave. Achilles is the main hero in Homer's Iliad amongst a plethora of great men in their struggle against Troy. Achilles in the Iliad experiences humiliation, anger, the loss of a close friend, the powerlessness of his fate, and the mortality of man. A man loved by the gods, whose power challenged fate itself. Yet, destined to live a short life. Achilles is chosen to be the main character in Homer's Iliad because he embodies the raw emotions that come with mortality. Achilles, a prideful hero destined to die when he stepped foot on Troy, loved by the gods, and chained by fate. ""Rage- Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,""(Iliad, 1.1-2).



Agamemnon, son of Zeus is infuriated because of a plague on the Achaeans. Prideful Agamemnon does not want to admit his mistake. To shift the blame, Agamemnon demands Briseis from Achilles. This implies that Achilles should also take the blame. This throws Achilles into a blinding rage where he almost kills Agamemnon had Athena not stopped him. Achilles tells Athena ""To witness the outrage Agamemnon just committed? I tell you this, and so help me it's the truth- he'll soon pay for his arrogance with his life!""(Iliad 1.238-240)



Agamemnon humiliates Achilles by requesting Briseis in front of his council. Agamemnon realizes Achilles growing power and influence. By requesting Briseis, Agamemnon reminds Achilles of his role in the Achaeans. Achilles with his damaged pride hands over Briseis. Angry and humiliated, Achilles claims that he will not fight in the upcoming battles. ""Never again, I trust, will Achilles yield to you, And I tell you this- take it to heart I warn you- My hands will never do battle for that girl



Neither with you, King nor any man alive""(Iliad 1.347-350)



Achilles who has been on the shores of Troy for 10 years fighting under Agamemnon feels betrayed by Agamemnon. Achilles feels the rage, humiliation, and powerlessness directed towards Agamemnon. With these feelings, Achilles seeks revenge and calls on his mother to persuade Zeus. Achilles asks her to ""persuade him, somehow, to help the Trojan cause, to pin the Achaeans back against their ships ‚Ä¶So even mighty Atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace Achilles, the best of the Achaeans.""(Iliad 1.485-490) Achilles no longer cares about winning the battle, but because his pride was damaged he wishes ruin upon the Achaeans. Enough ruin for the Achaeans to realize how much they need Achilles. Homer gives insight into how infantile Achilles is. Achilles has no sense of honor or loyalty towards the Achaeans. Achilles only wishes for the Achaeans to realize his usefulness and to rebuild his pride. Achilles, forced to realize his powerlessness wishes Agamemnon to feel the same way. This is the revenge sought by Achilles. The rage of his pride and the revenge sets in motion the beginning of Achilles's tragedy on the shores of Troy.



The death of Patroclus is a turning point between Achilles and his fate. Achilles was told that he had two fates, ""if I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy, my journey home is gone but my glory never dies. If I voyage back to the fatherland I love, my pride, my glory dies‚Ä¶ true, but the life that is left me will be long, the stroke of death will not come on me quickly. (Iliad 9.500-505) When Achilles hears of Patroclus's death, he is overcome by the grief of losing a close friend. Achilles feels more grief because he is the one that prayed the Trojans won. Had he not wished that Patroclus might not have died. Achilles feels guilty that he had a role to play in Patroclus's death. But he directs this towards Patroclus's killer, Hector. Achilles feels by desecrating Hector's corpse, he is honoring Patroclus. Homer gives Achilles a new perspective on life. That when it came to Patroclus's death, nothing else mattered. Achilles starts to throw away worldly desires. When Agamemnon states that he did not touch Briseis, Achilles brushed that off. Patroclus's death made Achilles decide that he is going to stay at Troy to fight. To avenge the death of a close friend and to clear some of his conscience and beat the Trojans back.



Homer's depiction of Achilles is one of a man who has everything he could ask for, yet doesn't realize what is the most important thing in his life. The one thing that makes Achilles choose to live a short life is the friendship with another person. Achilles had everything people strive for yet he put that aside when his closest friend died. Achilles' regret weighs heavy on his heart, regret that his pride was so big it took away the most important thing in his life. But Achilles also grows as a person realizing his powerlessness against the gods and his own fate. Achilles is the best of the Achaeans not because he is the closest to being a god but because he is closest to being human.

Make sure to use Reading Lolita in Tehran and The Naked Citadel readings in the essay for quotes and examples.,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by AI,95,Likely Human,42.86,0.02,17.85,"Authority figures, whether political leaders, educators, or military commanders, wield power based on a delicate balance of respect and trust. However, this authority is not immutable and can be subject to a gradual erosion over time. This essay explores the mechanisms through which authority figures can be weakened, drawing upon the narratives presented in ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" by Azar Nafisi and ""The Naked Citadel"" by Susan Faludi.

In ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" Azar Nafisi provides a poignant account of her experiences as a literature professor in post-revolutionary Iran. The authoritarian regime sought to control education and suppress dissent, particularly targeting liberal educators. Nafisi's refusal to conform to the prescribed ideology gradually weakened her moral authority in the eyes of the regime. This is evident in her assertion, ""A novel that does not uncover a hitherto unknown segment of existence is immoral. Knowledge is the novel's only morality"" (Nafisi, Reading Lolita in Tehran).

Similarly, in ""The Naked Citadel,"" Susan Faludi examines the challenges to the moral authority of an all-male military institution. The Citadel, known for its strict adherence to traditional gender roles, faces criticism when it comes under scrutiny for its exclusionary policies. The erosion of moral authority is exemplified through the experiences of Shannon Faulkner, who challenged the Citadel's gender restrictions and prompted a reevaluation of its principles.

Authority relies heavily on the trust placed in the figure by those under their influence. In ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" the protagonist, Nafisi, experiences the betrayal of trust by her own students, who succumb to the pressures of the regime. One of her students, Nassrin, epitomizes this betrayal when she accuses Nafisi, stating, ""You have made us into criminals"" (Nafisi, Reading Lolita in Tehran). The erosion of trust in the authority figure results from the students' fear and the pervasive atmosphere of surveillance.

Likewise, in ""The Naked Citadel,"" the trust in the institution is compromised as the Citadel administration resists change and refuses to admit female cadets. This betrayal of trust is highlighted through the reactions of the cadets themselves, who witness the institution's reluctance to adapt to societal shifts. Trust in an authority figure is fragile, and any betrayal, whether real or perceived, can initiate a gradual decline in the figure's influence.

The narratives presented in these works illuminate the complex nature of authority and its vulnerability to erosion. Challenges to moral authority, betrayal of trust, and cultural shifts are all factors that can contribute to a gradual weakening of an authority figure over time. In ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" the revolution in Iran marks a significant cultural shift, challenging the authority of intellectuals and educators. Nafisi reflects on the changing dynamics, noting, ""We, the revolutionary generation, would create a utopia where no authority would be needed, since all would be brothers"" (Nafisi, Reading Lolita in Tehran).

""The Naked Citadel"" similarly explores the impact of societal changes on authority. The Citadel's resistance to accepting female cadets reflects the clash between traditional values and evolving societal norms. The erosion of authority is evident as the institution struggles to maintain its outdated practices in the face of a changing world.

In conclusion, these stories serve as cautionary tales, prompting reflection on the delicate balance that sustains authority and the need for adaptability in the face of evolving circumstances. As society evolves, authority figures must navigate the complexities of maintaining trust, upholding moral integrity, and embracing change to ensure their enduring influence. The narratives of ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" and ""The Naked Citadel"" offer profound insights into the dynamics of authority, reminding us that even the most entrenched figures can experience a gradual decline if they fail to adapt to the shifting tides of morality, trust, and societal expectations.",AI tool was ChatGPT.

Make sure to use The Naked Citadel and The Mind's Eye readings in the essay for quotes and examples.,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely Written by AI,91,Likely Human,48.28,0.02,22.6,"Survival and change, two fundamental aspects of the human experience, are intricately intertwined, shaping our individual and collective destinies. The relationship between them is a delicate dance, where survival necessitates change and, conversely, change becomes a crucial mechanism for survival.

At its core, survival is a primal instinct shared universally among humans. John Elder Robison, in ""The Mind's Eye,"" acknowledges this fundamental drive, stating, ""The instinct for survival is universal. We can't imagine wanting to die, no matter what our mental condition might be"" (Robison). This instinct propels individuals to adapt to changing circumstances, demonstrating resilience and resourcefulness in overcoming challenges.

""The Naked Citadel,"" a poignant exploration of traditions at a military college, provides a distinct perspective on survival. The institutionalized practices become a crucible testing cadets' mettle, forcing conformity or facing consequences. One cadet reflects, ""You put up a facade to make it through, to survive"" (Lemann 120). Survival in this context is about navigating and adapting within the constraints imposed by the institution.

Change, often viewed with trepidation, is an essential catalyst for survival. The ability to evolve, discard outdated ideologies, and embrace innovation becomes paramount in facing life's ever-shifting landscapes. As Oliver Sacks notes in ""The Mind's Eye,"" ""The brain is a far more open system than we ever imagined, and nature has gone very far to help us perceive and take in the world around us"" (Sacks). The adaptability of the human mind reflects the necessity of change for survival.

In ""The Naked Citadel,"" cadets grapple with a tradition-bound institution resistant to change. The refusal to admit women reflects a resistance to societal shifts and an adherence to antiquated tradition. However, the winds of change are inevitable, and the institution is compelled to confront its deep-seated resistance. Survival, in this context, becomes synonymous with recognizing the imperative for change and adapting to an evolving world.

Survival and change intersect in the narratives of both works, emphasizing the intricate relationship between them. The survivalist instinct goes beyond enduring adversity; it involves recognizing when change is imperative for long-term survival. In ""The Mind's Eye,"" Robison, with Asperger's syndrome, navigates challenges by accepting his unique perspective and adapting to his surroundings. His journey exemplifies the symbiosis of survival and change, with acceptance and adaptation as vehicles for navigating life's complexities.

Similarly, in ""The Naked Citadel,"" cadets find themselves at the crossroads of tradition and progress. The institution's survival depends on its ability to adapt to societal shifts and address calls for inclusivity. The very survival of The Citadel hinges on its willingness to embrace change, acknowledging the evolving nature of societal norms and expectations.

""The Naked Citadel"" and ""The Mind's Eye"" offer profound insights into the intricate dance between survival and change. They underscore the necessity of adaptability and resilience, emphasizing that survival is not a static state but a dynamic process. The interplay between survival and change is a testament to the human capacity for growth, innovation, and transformation. In a world marked by constant flux, our ability to navigate the currents of change becomes not only a survival mechanism but a defining characteristic of our shared humanity.",AI Tool was ChatGPT.

Countries around the world rely heavily on controlling power to enforce their laws and regulations, some of which the public may disagree with. The history of mankind has many authoritative figures and almost every one of them has been met with some form of rebellion, whether subtle or violent. In Azar Nafisi's ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,""the men and women are bound by the unreasonable laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Women have to behave and look a certain way to be accepted in society, while men only have slight restrictions. In Susan Faludi's ""The Naked Citadel,""the administration of the military academy controls how the recruits are conditioned as well as the all-male culture they proudly defend. In both of these stories, the controlling power has been met with some form of opposition, which has the potential to ultimately establish a new regime. However, this cycle can go on forever because the current opposition will become the new authority figure, and thus will be met with another opponent in the future. During each of the cycles, the authority figure can be gradually weakened through the power of outsourcing, subtle disobedience, and active rebellion.

A controlling entity can be displaced by simply waiting for some external factor to do the job. Sometimes, it is not in the best interest of the victims to directly fight a much greater or powerful opponent than themselves. Inside of the Citadel, one cadet nervously looked around and ""spoke in a near whisper, and what he had to say had nothing to do with the lavatory etiquette or military tradition.'The great majority of the guys here are very misogynistic,' he said.'All they talk about is how girls are pigs and sluts'""(Faludi 72-74). The cadet is only one out of the entire student population and therefore does not have enough leverage to go up against the Citadel's administration. In this scenario, it would be illogical and impractical for the cadet to raise his voice and directly fight the Citadel because the obvious consequence is that he would be suspended or expelled. His efforts would go to waste because the Citadel would try to make him seem like a traitor to the rest of the student body, destroying the cadet's reputation forever. The only choice that the cadet has is to keep things under the table and just wait for somebody with the power to go up against the mighty Citadel. Fortunately, the cadet did not have to wait more than a lifetime to see the change that he envisioned. Shannon Faulkner came along and chose to leverage the almighty court system to decide the fate of the Citadel's all-male culture. In the end, the cadet's strategy of patience and outsourcing worked and the restrictions were displaced by a third party that surpassed the Citadel's controlling power. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic of Iran was terrorizing young females. When the group of females entered the school building, Sanaz began to cry and ""in between bursts of tears, she explained that she was late because the female guards at the door, finding a blush in her bag, had tried to send her home with a reprimand""(Nafisi 281). The small group of females is insignificant with respect to the entire population of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and therefore do not have enough backing of influencers or support to go up against the government of Iran. In this particular case, it would not make any sense for the group of females to raise its voice and directly fight the politicians because the consequence would be the death penalty. Iran is known for its unusual and harsh punishments for even the smallest of crimes. The group's efforts would be worthless because Iran would instill fear into the population by executing the criminals publicly. The only choice that the group of females has is to wait it out until some external party comes along that has the power and support to throw the Islamic Republic of Iran out. Unfortunately, the group might have to wait more than a lifetime to see the change they envisioned. In the end, the group's strategy of patience will work because they did not lose their lives fighting a battle not worth fighting alone. Despite the unreasonable laws and hardships, life would be preserved and the group of females may have held onto and experienced some of the happiest moments of their lives under the regime. Sometimes, focusing on the bright side of life is the wisest decision. The cadet and the group's strategy of patience and outsourcing was the best decision because they did not have the resources to directly fight the Citadel and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

If the victims have some strength, confidence, and resources, then they should definitely take advantage of the opportunity to get some of their freedom back by employing subtle disobedience. The Citadel had a very strict fitness requirement, but some cadets were not very fond of it. This comes to light when ""an alumnus recounted in court that many upper-classmen he knew who had failed the test skipped the punitive morning run and'sat around and ate doughnuts'""(Faludi 72). The cadets broke the rules which sends a strong message that they consider themselves strong and confident. After all, those are the characteristics that the academy is supposed to give them. The academy is going to have to live with this because it cannot afford to defame its prized all-male culture that it defends with its soul. Otherwise, it risks being criticized and most importantly risks giving females the leverage that they need in court. This gives the dissatisfied cadets a fantastic opportunity to take back some of their precious freedom. In this situation, the cadets were successfully able to employ subtle disobedience because they had some strength, confidence, and the opportunity to do so. When the group of females went to Nafisi's house for a discussion on fiction versus reality, Nafisi ""could not get over the shock of seeing them shed their mandatory veils and robes and burst into color. Gradually, each one gained an outline and a shape, becoming her own inimitable self""(Nafisi 279). The females disobeyed the Islamic Republic of Iran which sends a strong message that they consider themselves as strong and confident women. During that meeting, they took off more than their scarves and robes; they took the oppressive control and societal pressure off their chest and were finally able to breathe freely like never before. The government cannot do anything about it because it was sort of kept under the hood in Nafisi's house, so that the public cannot know about it. Otherwise, the group risks harsh punishments for their actions if they were to get caught by a supporter of the IRI. There is also the risk of an insider telling the Iranian government about Nafisi's little house meetings which the IRI can deem as a possible threat and the upbringing of a rebellion. Nevertheless, this presents the group of females with a fantastic opportunity, that they have taken advantage of, to take back some of their freedom from the oppressive Iranian government. This subtle disobedience will eventually accumulate, resulting in huge changes in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The cadets and the females' strategy of being resourceful was the best decision because they were able to take advantage of the opportunities available to them to get back their freedom.

When the lives of the victims have become unbearably miserable, the only option left is to ignite a fierce rebellion, which may or may not result in victory. Sometimes, it is in the best interest of the victims to risk it all and fight for their freedom, as the boundary between their miserable lives and defeat fades away. Shannon Faulkner's acceptance to the Corps of Cadets ""was rescinded once the administration discovered their error. Faulkner's attempt to gain entrance then shifted from the admissions office to the courts""(Faludi 71-72). She couldn't take it any longer and decided to ignite a fierce rebellion against the Citadel. What brought about this action was the fact that her life could not get any worse by going up against the administration. She had absolutely nothing to lose other than the costs associated with the court case. The thing is that even if she loses, she will still be the same girl who aspires to become a cadet and serve in the military. Gaining entrance into the Citadel only serves to provide a strong name recognition, however the rejection does not impact her abilities or goals in life. The biggest motivation behind this action was that the Citadel rejected her solely on the basis of her gender, and not any relevant metrics such as academic skills or qualifications. In addition, life under the Islamic Republic of Iran was getting worse. The university officials harassed Nafisi, therefore ""the students had threatened to boycott classes, and it was of some satisfaction to [Nafisi] to find out later that despite threats of reprisals, they in fact did boycott [Nafisi's] replacement""(Nafisi 282). The students were done with the unreasonable restrictions and decided to risk it all and fight for their freedom. Their lives were so miserable that it would not make any difference if they lost the battle, so all the fear in them disappeared into thin air. They knew that they had to at least try to get their freedom back, otherwise they would have to live miserably for the rest of their lives. They had to fight either for themselves or at least for their children. If they fought now, they could potentially be revered by their descendants for providing a free world just like the citizens of other countries. The Islamic Republic of Iran will probably gradually weaken over time as more and more people just like Nafisi and her students rebel. Shannon Faulkner and the students' strategy of active rebellion against an oppressive regime was the best decision because they had nothing to lose.

In conclusion, the art of doing nothing, disobeying unreasonable rules, and fierce rebellion are the three major gateways to weakening a powerful authority figure. Patience and outsourcing proved to be an invaluable strategy for the cadet and group because they lacked sufficient resources to directly fight the Citadel and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Being resourceful proved to be invaluable for the cadets and females as they were able to employ subtle disobedience. Active rebellion against an oppressive regime proved to be invaluable for Shannon Faulkner and the students as their lives could not get any worse. Authoritative figures have always been met with some form of resistance and will continue to do so for generations to come.",
5489,1- Entirely written by me,Write an essay that explains the relationship between survival and change. Make sure to use The Naked Citadel and The Mind's Eye readings in the essay for quotes and examples.,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,B,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,48,Likely Human,27.92,0.02,5.27,"Creatures have come into existence from what appears to be thin air. The main driving force behind this phenomenon is known as evolution. The word evolution does not have a clear, well-defined definition in the minds of others. In fact, evolution is a long-term process that does not hold any intentions nor expectations. It is just a natural flow from one state to another, involving ever so slight mutations, over a prolonged period of time. In contrast, urgency is expressed via abrupt, acquired characteristics over a short burst of time. The relationship between these two falls under interdependence. Survival, the biological purpose of life, is dependent upon some change to the existing state. The idea of interdependence can be viewed in The Naked Citadel, authored by Susan Faludi, where the survival of the Citadel is directly dependent upon the successful assimilation of the new societal norms. In this case, change is described as an urgency for the Citadel if it wants to continue being a prominent military academy. On the other hand, evolution can be seen in The Mind's Eye, written by Oliver Sacks, where the cells in the brain had to go through numerous stages of mutations before being able to rejuvenate the experience of life. Disabled persons can not acquire new senses overnight. It takes at least a few months for the body to snap itself out of shock and begin the process of healing or evolution. The relationship between survival and change can best be examined through the forces of evolution, urgency, and interdependence.

In the aftermath of a catastrophic event, change must be induced in order to minimize the loss. The induction of change is what kick starts the process of healing or evolution. Through observing numerous people with disabilities, one can presume that ""To become blind, especially later in life, presents one with a huge, potentially overwhelming challenge: to find a new way of living, of ordering one's world, when the old way has been destroyed""(Sacks 303). Losing sight all of a sudden would drastically impact how one goes about their daily routine from brushing teeth in the morning to sleeping at night. One would see no difference between day and night, which would mess up the circadian rhythm and reduce the chances of survival, all while trying to reorder one's world. The body would first need to fight this shellshock and then stimulate the brain to begin allowing more than usual mutations to occur. These slight changes to the brain's chemistry would prove invaluable in the future, minimizing the loss. After a few months or years, all of the changes would have congregated to allow the person to experience life again, whether the same as before or through a completely different lens. The Citadel also had to induce change in order to keep their proposed traditions alive. One student described the fitness requirements as ""forty-five pushups and fifty-five situps in two-minute sets, and a two-mile run in sixteen minutes. But the administration made passing the fitness test a requirement for graduation only after Shannon Faulkner filed suit""(Faludi 72). For such a high level of physical expectation, the Citadel ought to prevent many cadets from graduating, not just the females. The induction of this change in the tradition is brought about by Shannon Faulkner, the first female to join the cadets. Slight changes like this one accumulate like a rolling snowball, severely altering the original tradition set in place when the Citadel was initially founded. However, this raises the question of whether a tradition can truly be preserved amidst changes in societal norms, expectations, and the equal rights movement. This would mean that change is necessary or is a fundamental part of human nature, which cannot be extricated. The blind resolve to biological mutations to cater a new experience of life, while the Citadel resolves to adopt new rules and restrictions to preserve the so-called tradition, even though the adoption is clearly the adjusting transaction.

Changes can either be optional or demanded by a set of extenuating circumstances, which increases the urgency of the matter. When Hull initially became blind, he was maniacally frustrated because of ""the fact that he could no longer conjure up the faces of his wife or children, or of familiar and loved landscapes and places""(Sacks 304). His emotions and mental state at the time were unimaginably powerful, which allowed them to shake his body out of shellshock and demand some changes be made. This situation presents an urgent change that must be made, otherwise Hull risks losing all of his sanity and respect from his own family. After securing some changes to the brain's chemistry, Hull ""seemed to regard this loss of visual imagery as a prerequisite for the full development, the heightening, of his other senses""(Sacks 304). In this case, Hull was able to abruptly acquire certain new features and abilities that made him calm down, and realize that the fading of his visual memories was actually the light at the end of the tunnel. When a desire or situation arises that is out of one's control, adaptability becomes the key element to securing a successful future. A sense of urgency is also introduced in the Citadel's system, ""a nine-month regimen of small and large indignities intended to'strip' each young recruit of his original identity and remold him into the'Whole Man'""(Faludi 72). The system was set in place to brainwash these young lads so that they can become good, obedient soldiers. Without this swift change in the recruits' mentality, they would risk not having the ability to serve in the military as efficiently. Even though the recruits acquired an abrupt change both physically and mentally, the conditioning kind of goes against the Citadel's mission to preserve originality. Similar to the way they preserve the all-male tradition, they should also preserve the individuality of the recruits, while coming up with personalized military training based on the strengths and weaknesses of each recruit. Hull's deteriorating visual memory quadrupled the urgency for change, while the academy's goal of producing the best cadets exponentiated the demand for recruit conditioning.

Survival is primarily dependent on change, while change is independent of survival. The former can be seen in the life of Dennis, a clinical psychologist, who gradually became blind in his teens and ""could now recognize many of his patients by smell"", as well as ""pick up states of tension or anxiety which they might not even be aware of""(Sacks 312). Although studying in college without eyesight is hard enough, it is even more surprising that his career is still alive. A psychologist usually needs eyesight to understand the patient's body language and emotions, however Dennis proved that wrong, emphasizing the idea that survival is dependent on change. The rest of his senses and the brain rewired themselves to grant him a supernatural boon. In this case, the survival of his career is directly linked to the biological adjustments made. In addition, the biological adjustments are independent of his career's survival. The reason being that his career may as well have been doomed, but the heightening of his other senses ought to happen regardless. His career has no impact whatsoever on the mutations induced in his brain's neurons. The Citadel also introduced some changes including dismantling ""it's fourth-class system because it was getting in the way of their military training""(Faludi 80). The induction of this change was guaranteed by its desire to continue operating successfully. The United States military needed soldiers to be able to fight in the modern era of advanced technology, which paved the road for the Citadel's gradual assimilation of the new societal norms. ""The postwar years also brought the admission of women to the summer program, and without the hand-wringing provoked by Shannon Faulkner's application""(Faludi 80). The survival of the Citadel is directly dependent upon its ability to adapt, or approve of change, in its long lived traditions. If it declined the cues from the military, it would perish miserably. In order to live amidst a dynamic society, one that never ceases to change, an entity must learn to adopt new ways of operating. One important differentiating factor between survival and change is that the traditions may not be able to be preserved, however the Citadel will continue to experience change regardless. The survival of Dennis' career depends on biological change, but the adjustments are independent of the status of his career. Similarly, the preservation of the Citadel's traditions is dependent on adapting operating activities, but the changes are independent of the preservation of the traditions.

In conclusion, the relationship between survival and change can be expressed through the lenses of evolution, urgency, and interdependence. Both Sacks and Faludi provided excellent examples to support the analysis of the three lenses. All three of which can be seen in The Mind's Eye, when the loss of a valuable sense induces mutations in the body to minimize the loss. The shellshock would require the body to kickstart the process of evolution in order to reorder one's world, either through the rejuvenation of a sense or the granting of a supernatural boon. The need or desire to survive exponentiates the urgency of the matter. In this case, the survival of Dennis' career is directly dependent on the accumulation of changes that occur within the body. In addition to this relationship between the two factors, the mutations are independent of whether his career lives or perishes. The three lenses can also be viewed in The Naked Citadel, where the outrageously high physical expectations are integrated into the graduation requirements to try to prevent females from graduating. This, as logical as it may seem, is completely wrong because many males failed to graduate as well. In this case, the Citadel evolved in an attempt to preserve its beloved tradition of all-males. In addition, the academy's goal of producing the best fit cadets significantly skyrocketed the urgency of recruit conditioning. The preservation of the Citadel's traditions is directly dependent on the successful adaptation of operating activities. However, the adjustments are independent of whether or not the traditions actually maintain their original state. So, the relationship between the two is that survival can be either urgent or natural, and change is independent of whether an entity survives or deteriorates.",

Just as humans face threats like cavities and gum disease, marine life contends with their own dental dilemmas. Algae, parasites, and other dental villains wreak havoc on the teeth and gums of underwater creatures. Sharky, armed with his trusty toothbrush, sets out to tackle these issues head-on, making it his mission to keep the ocean's inhabitants smiling.

Sharky's daily routine involves patrolling the coral reefs and underwater caves, searching for marine friends in need of dental assistance. With his superhero agility, he navigates through the sea with finesse, swiftly brushing away plaque and tartar from the teeth of fish, turtles, and even the occasional dolphin. His dental justice knows no bounds, as he fearlessly confronts the dental dilemmas plaguing the deep blue.

Yet, Sharky doesn't stop at fighting dental villains; he takes on the role of an educator. Using his newfound ability to communicate, he spreads awareness about the importance of dental hygiene among the oceanic community. Through animated demonstrations and friendly conversations, Sharky ensures that every sea creature understands the significance of a healthy oral routine.

Like any superhero, Sharky has his share of allies and adversaries. The wise old sea turtle, Dr. Tidal, serves as Sharky's mentor, offering guidance on advanced dental techniques. On the other hand, the nefarious Plaque Pufferfish, a villainous creature with a penchant for spreading dental decay, constantly challenges Sharky's commitment to dental justice.

In the vast expanse of the ocean, where the importance of dental hygiene often goes overlooked, Sharky emerges as a beacon of oral health. Through his tireless efforts, this tooth-brushing shark superhero not only fights dental villains but also educates and inspires the oceanic community to prioritize their dental well-being. In Sharky's underwater realm, the battle for healthy smiles rages on, reminding us that even beneath the waves, the power of dental hygiene is a force to be reckoned with.","ChatGPT 3.5

109,1- Entirely written by me,The First Fitna,History,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,34,Likely Human,39.53,2,14.46,"The Seventh Century was a time period where old establishments came to an end, and new institutions filled the void left behind by these old orders. The balance of power between nations would permanently change allowing for new borders to be drawn out. The once mighty Persian and Roman Empires, who were considered to be the superpowers of the time, would face a series of new and unprecedented invasions from a people who they did not even consider a threat - the Arab Muslims. This new Islamic Caliphate, created by these invaders, would quickly overpower both the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires, ending Sassanid rule and seizing the majority of Byzantine territory. The Caliphate, dubbed the Rashidun Caliphate, would establish Islamic control over much of the Middle East and would become the new power of the time. The prosperity of this new state, however, would wane as disputes over succession threatened to cause a split in the Islamic community. The First Fitna or Islamic Civil war that took place between the years 656-661 CE. It would cause Islam to permanently fracture into numerous sects as a result of the infighting during this period of time. The events of the First Fitna were so significant because of the fact that it had caused a split in the religion of Islam; a phenomenon which would shape both the Islamic and non-Islamic world to the modern era.

The history and impact of the first Fitna can be addressed by analyzing a variety of sources. One such source is a biography of Abu Bakr by Zeki Saritoprak, a journalist at Oxford University, as well as another biography of Abu Bakr by Britannica, helps paint an even clearer view of the first Islamic Caliph and evaluate his influence on the first Fitna. An additional biography on the Caliph Umar by Syed Muhammad Khan from the World History Encyclopedia helps us determine how power was passed through these righteous Caliphs. Rizwi Faizer's biography on the Caliph Uthman, helps report about the final peaceful transition of power in the Caliphate. The article, How Did Sunni & Shia Beliefs About Caliphs Differ? by John Green, perfectly shows how the Shia and Sunni sects came to be, by displaying what they believe in. Finally Tabari and Bukhari are the most accurate accounts of what most likely happened during these times as they are the most trusted source on early Islamic history, respectively, because of their work in compiling numerous sources of that era.

The aspects of an event should not be seen from only one lens. Instead multiple different outlooks are required to create a full image on what really transpired. From the establishment of the Caliphhood to the question of succession and even to the modern day political climate of the world, many events can be traced back to the first Islamic civil war. The reasoning that fueled this conflict was that each individual group in the Caliphate had their own motives and a stake to benefit or detriment from. For example, the Qurra, chose to break away from Caliph Ali's forces (becoming the Kharijites), because they were scared of the persecution that could follow as a retaliation for the murder of the Caliph Uthman. For this very reason, it is important to see all sides of an event of this scale, to gather as much information as possible.

To understand the first Fitna, we must first understand the events leading up to it. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad established Islam in the seventh century. Through his efforts the religion was able to safely take hold in the deserts of Arabia. His death in the year 632 CE, begged for the question - who would succeed him as the leader of this new Islamic world? Caliph Abu Bakr Abdullah ibn Uthman Abi Quhafa, or Abu Bakr (given the title Al-Siddiq), would assume the role as the first Caliph of Islam. Abu Bakr, himself was reluctant to take the mantle of Caliph, however, according to Saritoprak in his biography of Al-Siddiq, the, ""community of the companions of the Prophet asked [Abu Bakr] to be the Caliph"", faced with these recommendations Abu Bakr accepted the position as Caliph (Saritoprak 1). Though Abu Bakr's ascension was one widely supported it was also a point of much discourse. According to the article, How Did Sunni & Shia Beliefs About Caliphs Differ? John Green, an attorney who has been writing on legal, business and media matters for more than 20 years, stated that the Shia belief on the Caliph is that, ""the first legitimate successor was Ali""(Green 3). Right at this point, the seeds of the first Fitna would be sown. Unfortunately, after only two years of becoming Caliph, Abu Bakr would perish, after having named a successor.

Umar ibn al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb (al-Farooq) would have one of the smoothest transitions of power for that era. Being appointed by Abu Bakr, he tried his best to fulfill his predecessors' will. Umar continued Islamic conquests in the Levant and Persia, while consolidating power in Arabia. As the successor to Abu Bakr, Umar was supported by the majority of the Ummah (islamic community). The ruler continued to establish new rules and regulations as Caliph, only increasing the nation's prosperity. Disastrously, Umar's rule was cut to an end after he was assassinated by a Persian slave named Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz during prayer time. According to Syed Muhammad Khan, a history enthusiast and a journalist at World History Encyclopedia, he writes in his biography of Umar, that the late Caliph had, ""appointed a six-member committee [on his death bed], comprised of able men to elect a new Caliph...Uthman was chosen as Umar's successor""(Khan 22). With the death of Umar, the third Caliph of Islam began a new administration.

Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was appointed by this committee, because he had pledged to continue the works of the prior two Caliphs, something his competitor Ali did not wish to do. Uthman's first actions were to create a standard copy of the Quran to prevent it from being tainted. Furthermore, he continued to expand the military, increase trade and strengthen the power of the aristocracy during his tenure as Caliph. At some point during his reign he caught wind of a growing rebellion against the government. To further pursue the cause of this dissent, Uthman sent trusted agents to Kufa, Basra, Syria and Egypt. The dissidents, Rizwi Faizer writes, ""...resented [Uthman] for appointing his irresponsible relatives as governors of Kufa, Basra, and Egypt""(Faizer 4). This rebellion against Uthman only continued to grow from this point. It accumulated in a platoon of rebels that marched towards Uthman's residence. There, these rebels would murder the Caliph in an event known as Yawm al-Dar. In the aftermath of the assasination, Ali ibn Abi Talib became the fourth and final Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate.

The question that Ali had to answer was what to do with Uthman's killers. He chose to not punish them and by doing so, gained a large faction which supported him for his decision on the matter. There were also many people angered at Ali's decision to pardon the killers of Uthman. Among this faction was Aisha, the wife of the Prophet. The Persian Traditionalist Muhammad al-Bukhari, one who is widely recognized and accredited with the most accurate hadiths (collection of traditions containing sayings of the prophet Muhammad) wrote, ""When Ali sent Ammar and [his son] Hasan to Kufa to call upon them [the inhabitants] to fight [against Aisha] Ammar made a speech. He said:'I know that she is his [the Prophet's] wife in this world and the next, but God put you to the test [whether] to be his followers or hers""(Spellberg 111). Ali was able to gather enough support to emerge victorious at the battle of the Camel (656 CE). Following the battle, Ali moved his capital to Kufa, a strategic city as it was in the center of the Islamic nation. Ali's troubles , however, did not stop there - as the governor of the Levant, Muawiyah I (cousin of Uthman) would challenge Ali. Trying to come to a peaceful resolution, Ali would try to make a deal with his opponent. Muawiyah would disregard these attempts and continued to prepare his troops for war. Both armies would eventually meet and encamp at Siffin, Syria. Tabari, an Islamic scholar who lived in 10th century Iran, documented that Ali addressed a group of Syrians at the Battle of Siffin (657 CE). He declared that both Muawiyah and his father, ""were members of those ""parties"" that persisted in enmity to God, His Prophet, and the Muslims...until they relunctantly entered Islam"". Despite his call for a rally against Muawiyah, Ali's troops did not wish to fight other Muslims. Subsequently, Ali was forced to accept an arbitration.

After Ali agreed to an arbitration, which in this situation, was a group of people who would appoint the next Caliph; many in his faction seceded. These people were called Kharijites, and rebelled against Ali. They feared the retribution of what would happen if Uthman was to be avenged and declared that judgment belongs to God alone. While Ali fought against this rebellion, his soldiers continued to desert. The civil war continued up until Ali's assasination in 661 by a Kharijite. Following this, Muawiyah I became the Caliph and ended the civil war. Muawiyah would declare himself the first Ummayad Caliph and would transform the Caliphate into a hereditary monarchy.

The first Fitna resulted in a complete rewrite of the Islamic world. The biggest transformation would be the Shia-Sunni split. The Sunnis, while still believing Ali to be a Caliph, do not believe he was the first Caliph. On the other hand, Shias disregard the other Rashidun Caliphs and defend the point that Ali is the rightful first Caliph of Islam. Socially, Shias and Sunnis also have slightly different ritual practices. They both celebrate similar and different holidays. They have different prayer schedules and celebrate marriage differently. This change also affected the world politically. With the eventual split of the Caliphate into numerous smaller nations, the boundaries of regions and people groups changed. Some regions were more likely to be Shia and Sunni than others and vice versa. Many alliances were built upon what your faith was and which Caliph you had your allegiance towards. It was an event which, because it affected the Islamic world at its very core, affected the rest of the world in a massive way as well.",
3700,1- Entirely written by me,Good or Bad: The Progress of AI,English,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely to be a mix of Human and AI,51,Likely Human,46.08,40,16.3,"The Industrial Revolution caused the division of labor to be irreversibly altered. Artisans and other careers that relied on handicrafts such as clothing, baskets, and furniture saw their livelihoods decline as such items could now be manufactured cheaper and faster at new factories. The article ""The Luddites: Machine-Breaking in Regency England,"" by E.P. Thompson, perfectly describes the environment artisans found themselves in during the industrial revolution. The Luddites, those who protested against factories, were vehemently against the social and economic changes brought about by industrialization (Raymond 601). As time passed, Raymond observed that it became clear the Luddites were unsuccessful as technology continued to improve. The modern bread-making process only proves this fact as reality, Mario Fravolini shares. Fravolini is a food engineer who wrote the article, ""optimal operation of the leavening process for a bread-making industrial plant,"" for the Journal of Food Engineering. The article conveys how a bread factory can produce the best results as it showcases the different machinery used to produce products with the best efficiency and quality (Fravolini et al. 289). With the global rise of automation, humans can support the industrial process more safely. Both Thompson and Fravolini agree that factories are now able to manufacture items at extreme rates that, in the past, would take a lengthy amount of time. The next monumental change coming to the workforce and the world is artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of great interest and debate in recent years, with many experts hailing it as the next big technological revolution and others raising concerns about its impact on society and the workforce, according to Mary Richardson. Richardson is a peer-reviewed academic author who argues that every aspect of our daily lives has been transformed by AI-powered technologies (Richardson and Clesham 1). In, ""Rise of the Machines? The Evolving Role of AI Technologies in High-Stakes Assessment,""artificial intelligence is defined as the continued development of computerized systems so that these systems can perform duties that would otherwise require human intelligence to complete. The functionality of AI systems is a verifiable way to improve accuracy (Richardson and Clesham 1). One example of this is spell-checking. Spell checking is an automated way to correct a user's spelling in an essay, a process entirely handled by an AI. Based on this technology and others like it, Richardson observes that the potential benefits of AI and its role in shaping the future are the primary reasons for its continued development. The article believes that the use of AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives by increasing efficiency and productivity to improve decision-making and personalization. The article, ""Mediating artificial intelligence developments through negative and positive incentives,"" by Anh Han, a professor at the school of computing and digital technologies at Teesside University, captures both sides of the coin perfectly. It is important to also consider the potential challenges and ethical implications that come with the development and implementation of AI technology. Many are anxious about AI development as they believe they may miss out (Han et al. 1). Han argues that examining the current state of AI, such as its potential impact on various industries and society as a whole and the necessary considerations for its responsible development and use, is needed to gain an understanding. Even though AI is bringing positive change by reducing the number of activities humans need to do, there is a debate over whether it is indeed a positive change for the world.
AI algorithms and systems can process and analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing. The article, ""An Explainable AI Decision-Support-System to Automate Loan Underwriting""by Sachan Swati, Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence in Finance at the University of Liverpool Management School, captures this perfectly. The journal-entry reviews how AI is improving life-for example, the speed of loan applications has greatly improved. The information about the loan application process provided shows that banks receive hundreds of loan requests monthly, and each request can be time-consuming to process. Applicants could end up waiting days, months, or even years to get a yes or no back from the bank. Swait and associates shows how one system deployed by UK banks, X-Mate, is innovating the loan acceptance process by introducing an algorithm that determines if someone can take a loan by determining their risk level. The algorithm is exponentially faster than a human application reviewer as it can view a person's application within an hour-an exponential improvement compared to the strenuous days many have had to endure to receive a response (Sachan et al. 2). The article uses this example and others to show that AI does not only improve the efficiency of the finance sector but also impacts the speed of other sectors like food service and computer science.
Two separate news outlets, Food Management, and the Digital Journal, take the initiative to report on how the introduction of smart kitchens to the restaurant scene is changing the business. One restaurant has already implemented artificial intelligence to help manage coffee production. Digital Journal introduces Panera as a caf√© chain operating over 2,000 locations that is also currently implementing systems that give restaurant staff the ability to monitor coffee with the help of AI. The goal of such a plan is to eliminate the need for humans to monitor the status of coffee (Buzalka 1). The information is verifiable because Panera is a company that has shown a positive attitude toward AI developments in the past. Food Management reveals the company has already installed digital menus, mobile ordering interfaces, and kiosks to allow users to order without needing face-to-face interaction. All these changes make the life of a crew member less stressful, as it is now easier to fulfill duties because they have a reduced workload due to technological assistance (Buzalka 2). All in all, the implementation of AI allows for more efficient practices across multiple business sectors.
However, the development and implementation of AI also raise important ethical considerations. The primary concern with these developments is: what about the careers that are disappearing as artificial intelligence advances? A credible newspaper, The Economist, has more information to provide for the conversation. With over 1.6 million copies in circulation, The Economist has a prominent role to play in data journalism. The article ""Automation and Anxiety: The Impact on Jobs"" by The Economist reveals that a large portion of jobs are at risk of loss. Both white-collar and blue-collar career paths are at risk. The Economist remains skeptical about how beneficial AI will be but reports that it is undeniable that jobs will be lost. In the United States of America, 47% of jobs are at risk of being replaced by automation (ƒ∞≈ûCAN 80). In his article ""An Old Problem in a New Era: Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Unemployment on the Path to Industry 5.0,"" Professor Iscan, an economist at Turkey's √áukurova University, discusses the plight of cashiers. Iscan introduces new in-store technologies by sharing how it is becoming common to see self-checkouts in large stores; self-checkouts are convenient in the face of long lines, but they defeat the need for a human cashier. However, even in the face of this bleak fact, this article recognizes that artificial intelligence does have some positives. The article does believe that jobs will be added as human labor will be required to complete tasks in support of automation (ƒ∞≈ûCAN 83). Steven Gonzales reveals in his article, ""Artificial Intelligence: Advancing the Workforce of the Future,"" that AI is leading the workforce by creating new jobs in every industry of the global market. For example, there is a clerk who now manages self-checkouts, a position that did not exist in the past (Gonzales 28). Even with such a development, it is still too early to decide which jobs will sprout up tomorrow.
Keeping humans in the workforce remains a top priority, even with rapid AI progression. Stefan Wolter, an accomplished researcher with over five published peer-reviewed articles, explains what skills people should acquire in preparation for the shift in the workforce. In his article, ""Skills for Future Workers,"" he recognizes that computers will be able to replace a majority of the workforce as the tasks a computer can do today can already replace most low-level cognitively demanding careers (Wolter 12). Law Professor Jon Choi of the University of Minnesota Law School declares that such a development has already happened, as a new AI, ChatGPT, recently passed the BAR exam. The AI bot took four BAR exams, and earned a passing score (Leighton 1). Wolter advises his readers that they should pay attention to skills that machines would have a hard time completing as computers will change society to have an extremely different organization of work. Social skills will become more useful than they are today moving forward, as such roles rely more on human interaction (Wolter 12). Even with his extensive research, Wolter admits that the future of the workforce cannot yet be fully predicted.
While it is undoubtedly true that AI will have an impact on the workforce, it is also impacting life at home in more ways than one. Security has been something people have been investing in for centuries and the ring doorbell is one device that has changed the game by being able to record kidnappings and also greet Amazon delivery drivers, S. Elwood observes. ""The Ring doorbell: A case study of how smart home technology is transforming public safety"" by S. Elwood, R. Whitty, and R. J. Biddle, published in the Journal of Cybersecurity, examines how the Ring doorbell, as a smart home technology, is transforming public safety by providing a way for citizens to monitor and report suspicious activities. The authors provide a prelude stating that before the advent of automated motion detection systems, security cameras recorded events without discrimination, forcing a manual human review of the footage. The ring doorbell is revolutionary as it automatically detects and reports when a person is nearby, letting the owner know when it is crucial to view the camera (Elwood et al. 20). AI can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns, making it especially useful for security purposes.
Outside of home security, quality of life is something from which AI directly benefits. The phrase ""Open Sesame"" was a magical code word Ali Baba used to get into a thief's den in One Thousand and One Nights. ""AI in the Home: Transforming Domestic Life through Intelligent Systems'' by Michael J. Albers and David A. Bader, published in the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, discusses how AI is being used to create intelligent systems that can improve the way we live in our homes, including things like automation, personalization, and security. The authors also explore how these systems are similar to the ""open sesame"" command used in the story of Ali Baba, where a simple phrase can open up a whole new world of possibilities (Albers et al. 2). Artificial intelligence has made the folktale of Ali Baba a reality. The article shows the capabilities of modern day smart homes as these systems can lock and unlock doors; turn on and off lights, fans, and ovens; play music; sound an alarm when food is about to burn; and so much more. K. R. P. Hanson and T. S. Kohno's paper ""The Impact of AI on the Internet of Things: A Study of Amazon Alexa and the Smart Home"" from the IEEE Security & Privacy journal examines the impact of AI on the Internet of Things, specifically how Amazon Alexa and other smart home devices are changing the way people interact with technology in their homes and how it affects privacy, security, and the boundary between public and private spheres (Hanson 20). While systems like Alexa have improved home ambiance, there is consistent worry about AI and privacy.
Enjoying activities without constantly having to look over your shoulder is the concept of privacy (Elwood et al. 21). The article shows that a major concern people have is that AI gives hackers an unhindered view into your home, a place where you should be free of prying eyes. There have been numerous cases of hackers using camera systems to watch and sometimes communicate with residents. According to a Los Angeles grand jury indictment, two persons hacked Ring security cameras to broadcast swatting, serving as a stark reminder of the downside of smart home security (Shanklin 1). Justifiably, people have been left bewildered, but such events are rare occurrences. Fortunately, whenever a firewall is breached, companies are on top of it by quickly uploading a fix.
Even in the 2020 presidential debate, the subject of artificial intelligence has proven to be divisive. In the New York Times article, ""His 2020 Slogan: Beware of Robots""by Kevin Roose, Yang's plan is discussed in detail. As automation is set to eliminate many jobs and displace thousands of people, hopeful candidate Andrew Yang advocated for a universal basic income to keep workers afloat (Roose 2). Artificial intelligence has become such a topic of interest that many have referred to it as ""the major event of the century,""and everyone has their own thoughts to share (Roose 3). One thing is certain, the emergence of the new information age will alter our very way of life.
In conclusion, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life, including healthcare, education, and home life. In his article, ""Automation and artificial intelligence in the clinical laboratory,"" Christopher Naugler explains that with the progression of AI and automation, the entire health sector is changing. The integration of AI-powered systems, such as Amazon Alexa, can enhance the way we interact with technology and make our lives more convenient (Naugler and Church 100). However, as with any new technology, some potential risks and challenges must be considered, particularly those concerning privacy and security. Based on the evidence shared - continued research and development needs to be conducted to fully understand the impact of AI and to ensure that it is implemented responsibly and ethically. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI in society will depend on how well we can balance the benefits and risks and how we can use this technology to make our lives better.",
3058,4- AI-generated,Write an essay about world hunger,Other,Other,A,Likely Written by AI,97,Likely Human with a few AI-like Sentences,58.33,0.04,34,"Title: Hunger Knows No Borders: A Human Tale of the Global Crisis



In a world brimming with plenty, the stark reality of hunger persists as a haunting specter, casting shadows over millions of lives. World hunger, an affliction that transcends boundaries and nations, paints a harrowing picture of deprivation and inequality. It's a tale of human suffering etched in the fabric of society, a narrative that demands empathy, action, and a collective resolve to eradicate this profound injustice.

At the heart of the issue lies the paradox of abundance amidst scarcity. The world produces enough food to feed its entire population, yet hunger persists. Access, distribution, and unequal resource allocation render millions food-insecure. Poverty, conflict, climate change, and systemic inequalities converge to deepen the roots of hunger, ensnaring vulnerable communities in its grip.

In the labyrinth of hunger, poverty emerges as a relentless adversary. Families living below the poverty line face an uphill battle, juggling meager resources to secure even a semblance of sustenance. Children, innocent souls brimming with potential, bear the brunt of this predicament. Malnutrition stifles their growth, hampers cognitive development, and casts long shadows over their futures.

Conflict amplifies the pangs of hunger, disrupting food systems and displacing communities. The ravages of war tear apart the fabric of societies, leaving behind displaced populations struggling to procure the most basic of necessities-food being chief among them. The collateral damage of conflict extends beyond physical injuries, leaving deep scars of hunger and trauma that persist for generations.



Climate change, an omnipresent threat, exacerbates food insecurity. Erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, and extreme temperatures disrupt agricultural cycles, leading to crop failures and diminishing yields. Small-scale farmers, the backbone of food production in many regions, bear the brunt, grappling with unpredictable climates and diminishing resources.

The narrative of hunger is not confined to distant lands; it reverberates within the confines of urban centers as well. Homelessness and food insecurity haunt the streets of bustling cities, painting a stark contrast against the backdrop of abundance. Food deserts, areas devoid of access to nutritious and affordable food, compound the struggles of marginalized communities, perpetuating cycles of hunger and poverty.

Yet, amidst this stark reality, rays of hope illuminate the path forward. Initiatives sprout, championing sustainable agriculture, equitable distribution, and community empowerment. Local organizations and global partnerships collaborate to address the root causes of hunger, striving to provide not just immediate relief but long-term solutions.

Education emerges as a beacon, empowering communities with knowledge and skills to break the shackles of hunger. Initiatives that focus on empowering women, who often play pivotal roles in food production and family nutrition, prove instrumental in creating sustainable change.



The fight against world hunger demands a multifaceted approach-a symphony of policy changes, investment in sustainable agriculture, advocacy for equitable distribution, and a commitment to building resilient communities. It requires not just compassion but a systemic overhaul to dismantle the structures that perpetuate this injustice.

As inhabitants of this interconnected world, the onus lies upon each of us to be agents of change. Every action, whether small or grand, contributes to the narrative of hope, weaving together a tapestry of compassion and solidarity. Through collective efforts and unwavering commitment, we can script a new chapter-a world where hunger becomes a relic of the past, where every stomach is filled, and every individual thrives.

Beyond its health ramifications, COVID-19 cast a long shadow over the global economy. Industries grappled with abrupt closures, supply chain disruptions, and financial instability. Small businesses, once vibrant expressions of entrepreneurial dreams, faced the grim reality of closure. Job losses and economic downturns rippled across communities, exacerbating inequalities and deepening the chasm of disparity. The pandemic laid bare the vulnerabilities of our economic structures, compelling us to reassess resilience and equitable systems.

However, the impact of COVID-19 was not solely confined to physical health and finances; it etched profound imprints on our mental and emotional landscapes. Isolation became a collective experience, challenging the fabric of human connections. The absence of physical proximity gave rise to an amplified sense of loneliness, triggering mental health concerns. Anxiety, depression, and a pervasive feeling of uncertainty became unwelcome companions in the daily lives of many. Coping mechanisms varied, but the shared struggle illuminated the importance of empathy, support, and destigmatization of mental health discussions.

Amidst the darkness, glimmers of hope emerged through collective resilience and innovation. Science triumphed with the development of vaccines in record time, offering a ray of optimism in combating the virus. Communities rallied together, showcasing solidarity through mutual aid initiatives, volunteerism, and acts of kindness. Technology bridged the gap of physical distance, allowing virtual connections to flourish, redefining the way we work, learn, and interact.

COVID-19 serves as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of our world. It dismantled geographical borders, underscoring the universality of our vulnerability and resilience. It prompted introspection, urging us to reevaluate priorities, cherish moments of togetherness, and foster a deeper appreciation for the preciousness of life.

As we navigate the aftermath of this global upheaval, lessons abound. The imperative to fortify healthcare systems, address socio-economic disparities, and prioritize mental health on par with physical well-being loom large. The echoes of this pandemic will reverberate for years to come, leaving an indelible mark on our collective consciousness.

In the ebb and flow of life, COVID-19 stands as a testament to human adaptability, compassion, and strength. It challenged us to confront adversity, adapt to uncertainties, and emerge stronger, forging a new narrative of resilience and hope in the chapters yet to be written.

5845,1- Entirely written by me,How is Governor Murphy's Green energy plan coming into succession?,Other,100 or 200 level Undergraduate,A,Likely Written by Human,3,Likely Human,28.43,0.02,20.6,"Governor Murphy has ambitious plans for making the state of New Jersey use only clean energy by the year 2050. In order to cut greenhouse emissions, Governor Murphy proposed a bill that would require commercial buildings such as schools, apartments to replace gas heating systems with electric boilers. Essentially, this would help New Jersey with its Energy Master Plan which aims to achieve 100% clean energy by 2050 (EMP 2019). For advocates of clean energy, this bill means reducing greenhouse emissions enough to achieve the ""80-by-50 target""which is the goal of reducing carbon pollution by 80% below the levels in 2006 by the year 2050 (Johnson 2022). In order to cut greenhouse emissions, Murphy decided to put forth a ban on gas boilers, which received quite a lot of backlash from the business, building owners, schools, and those who would be financially affected. Murphy planned this ban so that pollutants could be cut drastically. Supporters of this mandate are looking past the cost and towards the positive impacts that it would have on the environment and reducing the effects of climate change. However, the cost of replacing heating systems with electric boilers is too much for many businesses, schools, and other commercial buildings, with around $2 million for each building to comply with the mandate (Johnson 2022). As a result, many business owners and building owners have banded together to fight against the mandate. Both the cornucopian and environmental sides of the debate were in full force when it came to this decision. The turmoil created by this bill has resulted in a legislative review of the possible mandate.

On one side of the argument was the Republican party which falls under a social political group. The Republican citizens/voters in New Jersey typically have more conservative views and value individual liberty as well as a thriving economy (NJ GOP 2020). Republicans have a history of promoting the economy, voting for lower taxes, and prefer to defend oil and other industries so that a thriving business does not end and people keep the jobs that they already have. The values of this group lean towards strong cornucopianism. For the Republican party as a whole, environmental issues are not at the top of the list and many even believe that global warming is not real, or is not as big of a crisis as it is said to be. With that being said, Murphy's mandate is something that many republicans took issue with and made sure to fight against it. This mandate would threaten multiple oil heat businesses, and was seen as an infringement on personal property. In alliance with organizations such as Fuel Merchants Association of New Jersey and New Jersey Business & Industry Association, Republicans such as Senator Anthony Bucco made sure to present why this would be a problem for New Jersey residents. Bucco stated that ""It would have been a massive and unnecessary cost for both businesses and taxpayers,""when responding to Governor Murphy's possible mandate (Bucco 2022). Bucco and other Republicans pushed back heavily and were happy to see the bill get rejected. The Republican voters in New Jersey had the power of money as many Republicans involved in fighting against the mandate were business owners themselves. They had some power in people since so many opposed the bill, however it would still prove to be difficult because New Jersey is a widely democratic state. Expertise was their weakest power. This is because their main argument focused on why this would be bad for people's wallets, rather than how effective electric boilers were compared to gas.

While financial burdens are a big topic in this argument, the other environmental side is fighting for the benefits that the mandate would have. For example, the civil society organization Environment New Jersey works to promote clean energy and focuses on environmental

issues in New Jersey. They engage in environmental issues, including education on

pollution, protecting and fighting for clean air and water initiatives, activism, and are involved with legal action. They were first established in 2003 as a state chapter of Environment America and have been promoting their cause for clean energy and quality air ever since (Environment America 2022). This organization is a strong environmentalist group and has stated on their page that ""they must think big and act boldly.""This makes Governor Murphy's mandate against gas boilers very important to this organization, and has gained a lot of support from Environment New Jersey. They were one of the few groups that were advocating for the bill against gas boilers, alongside the Department of Energy Protection. However, after the mandate was rejected, Doug O' Malley, Director of Environment New Jersey stated that "" You can't electrify the building sector by extending the life of fossil fuel boilers‚Ä¶DEP needs to come back to this issue,""(Johnson 2022). The political resource that is strongest in this organization is the power of expertise. The staff is made up of researchers, advocates and attorneys, and organizers (Environment America 2022). With their expertise, they were advocating for the mandate to further support Governor Murphy's Energy Master Plan.They lack a lot in terms of money. Since they are a nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization, this is an area of political resources that they are lacking in. Environment New Jersey held onto their expertise and it is what gave them the grounds they needed for their side of the debate.

Ultimately, a bill was passed on February 28th, 2022 by NJ Legislature that would prevent the state from mandating any gas or electric heating systems (NJ Legislature 2022). However, this bill does not bar state incentives for those who switch to electric heating systems. This bill was brought forth by senators who sponsored the Senate Community and Urban Affairs Committee which advanced legislation to make a decision in their favor (Sarlo et al. 2021). The passing of this bill which restricted Murphy's mandate was a setback for him, but a win for cornucopians. This also puts into perspective how expensive clean energy can be. Raymond Cantor, Deputy Chief of Jersey Business & Industry Association stated ""They are beginning to understand the complexities and cost implications of building electrification,'' (Johnson 2022). However, the Murphy Administration still has hope and plans to continue discussion around greenhouse emissions and its affordability (Johnson 2022).

Throughout this process, the issues residing in clean energy and cost were put into perspective as to how difficult it would be to implement clean energy, especially so quickly. The environmentalists and cornucopians had their respective reasons for being either for, or against Murphy's ban on gas heating systems. However, the cornucopians were able to fight for their side and ultimately win their stance through the state legislature. This shows how immediate change is not possible, even with current technology. However, this does not mean that going electric is something far-fetched. Murphy's Administration is still working towards a state that runs off of clean energy, however cost needs to be taken into consideration especially in a state that is as expensive as New Jersey.

Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are probably the most important and useful inventions yet. Their outstanding capability to fly up at high distances and to be able to pilot themselves without a human, has helped many military services. Not only were drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, helpful then, they are still very useful today. Recently, however, drones are being utilized to capture eye opening pictures and videos from high above. This invention is causing the film industry and the quality of videos and movies very professional and hi-tech. More and more people are intrigued by this invention. Overall, unmanned aerial vehicles and drones have impacted many people and has helped our military in various ways.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have been around for many years now. Back then they were mostly used for military purposes, such as making plots and maps for where they needed to attack. For example, back in the 1800's, the Austrians would use hot air balloons and other devices that stored explosives in them which was used to attack their opponents. "" The earliest recorded use of a UAV dates back to 1849 when the Austrians attacked the Italian city of Venice using unmanned balloons that were loaded with explosives""(O'Donnell 1). These drones and UAVs have helped the military so much especially with fighting overseas and not having to worry about having thousands of soldiers dying or being injured along with their fighting supplies getting destroyed.

There were many inventors that had a contribution to the invention of the drone and UAVs. To begin, a man named Nikola Tesla was the mastermind behind the invention of the drones and unmanned aerial vehicles. It all started with a demonstration that Tesla had shown to people. "" Tesla gave a demonstration in which a control box that transmitted radio signals was used to maneuver a toy boat along a pool of water. Outside of a handful of inventors who had already been experimenting with the technology, few people had even known about the [existence of radio waves] (https://www.thoughtco.com/invention-of-radio-1992382)""(Nguyen 4). Next, Reginald Denny made the very first remote controlled aircraft. This was the first unmanned aerial product that was produced here in America and it casted a huge impact on the manufacturing and supplying of the UAVs and drones to the military.

Drones and UAVs are usually not a threat to safety nor do they have many issues with them. However, recently they have been becoming a danger because of the way people have been utilizing them. One issue is that many people have been complaining that these drones are violating their privacy. A danger is that there have been some reports that drones are flying too close to the airplanes and helicopters. This is a huge danger because if it happens to collide with an airplane or helicopters it can cause the airplane to crash as well which can result in a loss of many lives. However, in order to avoid such accidents, there have been many rules set in place. Examples of these rules would be, not to fly the drone above 400 feet, and not to fly near airports or any other aircrafts.

Drones have went through many evolutionary changes since it was first invented and used. Back in the 19th century, UAVs were balloons that were stored with explosives so they can attack their opponents. . They soon started creating mini remote control cameras that could be used to spy on others. The drones started to change more and more. Now they can come in all different sizes. They are also remote controlled with a compartment that holds your phone or ipad that shows you what exactly you are recording. Before, drones were used for military purposes. Nowadays, they are used for many purposes other than war. One way, drones are used are for monitoring the weather. They are also used to deliver packages and items around to people who were affected by the natural disasters. Most importantly they are used for photography. It captures many videos from high angles. Drones are becoming a very high demand especially for the film industry. We are not using drones completely for the purpose of war but this invention has come into use for many things now, hence making it a very useful object.

Ever since the invention of drones and UAVs have been introduced it has changed the way many things function. It has saved the loss of many peoples' lives and helped us with many problems. I think that the invention of drones and UAVs is incredibly useful. There are so many uses for it. Amazon started to use it to deliver packages to people. Another use is that you can take eye catching pictures and videos. Before without drones, we were unable to take these pictures. Infact, we would not even know how the landscapes would look without these drones. Now we just fly the drone above and it captures amazing quality videos and pictures for us to enjoy. During the times of war, many people would lose their lives from fighting. This invention saved so many lives and did not have to worry about losing their valuable pilots.

I personally do own a drone. I use it all the the time. When I was a kid, I was not allowed to play with remote control cars or helicopters, so when I was 16 years old my dad bought me a drone to take pictures and videos with. I love it so much. I love photography, so I always wanted something very good to capture pictures with. It has actually made the task so much easier for me. Before I had to use my camera and zoom in and out to actually get a decent picture. However, now it is much easier and I get the best pictures and videos.

The drones are going to come in so much more use as planned for the future. To begin, they will come in use for delivering packages right to your doorstep. They will be making big blimps that will be releasing little drones that will be carrying our packages. Next, these drones will soon be used for transportation. ""This is due, in part, to the innovation of flying taxis, with several companies exploring this technology, such as [Ehang Corp in China] (https://www.popsci.com/ehang-passenger-carrying-drone?utm_source=datafloq&utm_medium=ref&utm_campaign=datafloq), and Volocopter, who will be [trialling two-seater drone taxis in Dubai this year] (https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/dubai-volocopter-passenger-drone-test/?utm_source=datafloq&utm_medium=ref&utm_campaign=datafloq)""(Datafloq). There will be races held to see which drone will win the relays and the races. In Japan, they are trying to invent insect sized drones to help them with agriculture. It will come in use for pollinating the plants. Importantly, these drones will be used for safety and rescue reasons. Suppose there is a person drowning in the distance where the lifeguards won't be able to see, unfortunately, they would be unable to save the person because they never knew they were drowning to begin with. However, with the drones in place the lifeguards can always keep an eye out for people's safety to prevent anyone from danger or from drowning. Lastly, drones will have the capability to help repair broken buildings and other construction related things. Inventors are planning to add 3D printers to the drones so they can repair buildings as they are flying. ""Drones also hold great potential in the construction industry, with the market for this technology expected to be worth in excess of $11 billion in the future.

One innovation, which is being developed at Imperial College London, is the creation of drones which are equipped with 3D printers. This remote-controlled equipment will be able to construct and repair buildings by printing materials as they fly ""( Datafloq).

Drones and UAVs have caused many things to change in our economy. We have more safety because of this invention. This will prevent robberies, and help us catch the culprits much easier. It helps us prevent problems from becoming bigger by alerting us beforehand. They are transporting packages to people in need. There has been a news where drones have started delivering medicines to people who are in need in a much faster rate in order to help with emergencies.

Many industries have started to use the drone. Industries such as: Agriculture, Architecture and Construction, Drones-As-A-Service, Emergency services, Engineering, Environmental Conservation, and Media. In agriculture, they use drones to check on their crops and to also help them cultivate. In architecture, they are used to help repair broken items and to help gain an understanding of how the building looks from afar. In emergency services, they usually fly drones above oceans and other places that may have danger involved to prevent any harmful accidents from occurring. They also use this to deliver medicines to patients who are in need. Drones are usually created and made in the field of engineering. Most importantly, media uses drones a lot! They are being used for filming big hit movies and they capture many videos and pictures from a great height. This invention has got them a lot of people to come watch their movies because the quality is getting much better of these movies. They are also used for our wars and help us with our weaponry. It carries our bombs and other equipment that helps us defeat our enemies. If drones were not to be used anymore, it would affect our military the most. Many of us rely on the drones because we do not want to risk the lives of thousands of soldiers fighting in the wars with many explosives. Another industry it could really affect is the media industry. Many people enjoy watching movies that are eye catching and that have really good quality to them. If the movies go from really good quality to not having any good quality left then that could really hurt their industry. Many people would stop coming to watch movies which will cause them to lose millions of dollars. The other industries would not be too affected by the drones because they have other machinery that can do the work for them. It is just that the drone would make it so much easier for them to get the work done much faster and much more efficiently. For example, for delivering the packages to our doorstep using a drone is not really necessary or required. We have trucks and cars that deliver these packages to our house either way. So, without the use of drones we can still receive our packages.

Based on my research on drones and UAVs, I believe that drones are a very important invention in our society. Without them we would have lost so many people in our military, not be able to have good quality videos, and be able to save people from dangers. This technology has been evolving and will be evolving into much more intricate designs which will soon help us with everything. They are simply just flying cameras for now, but soon they will be created into flying cars and taxis, have 3d printers placed in them, and much more to help us with our innovations. Drones are so useful to our humanity and they will always continue to be very useful in the future as it evolves.",
